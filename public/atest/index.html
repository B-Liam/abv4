Thyme is commonly sold in garden centres, but will grow well from seed. The seed is planted in spring either outside when the weather warms, or earlier indoors. Thyme does less well in heavy soils, and if this is the case, it is better to grow in pots.

Thyme does like to be overwatered, and prefers soil on the dry side. If growing in pots, ensure there is good drainage. The soil should never be completely dry, and pot plants will need watering in hot weather.

Thyme is a hardy perennial, provided that in winter it is not left to stand in too wet or waterlogged soil. Giving the plant a good cutting at the end of summer can help invigorate the plant to produce new growth in the following spring (new growth has the best tasting leaves).
