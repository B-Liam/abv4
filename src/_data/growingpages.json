In heavy soils, asparagus is better grown in raised beds using fresh compost. All male varieties are preferred as they devote all their energy to growing spears rather than producing seed.\n\nAsparagus is planted in the spring by digging a trench approximately one spade head deep and thirty centimetres or one foot wide. Down the middle of the trench the soil should be ridged, or elevated, so that when planted the crowns are placed at the top of the ridge with the roots running downwards along the sides. The trench is filled with soil so that only the tips of the crowns are exposed (5 centimetres or two inches).\n\nThe crowns need two years to become established, with only light picking recommended in this period. During this time, an asparagus bed needs to be kept weed free, a task done by hand to avoid disturbing the roots below the surface. Once a bed is mature, weeding remains as the biggest challenge. Asparagus plants grow tall but provide little leaf cover to the soil, giving the opportunity for weeds to germinate at their base. There is no shortage of wild seed flying across an allotment, and the result is that a gardener needs to be constantly clearing away weeds when young, to avoid disturbing the soil and risk damaging the roots of the asparagus crowns.\n\nTowards the end of the harvest, a few asparagus spears should be allowed to mature, to give the plants energy for the following yearâ€™s harvest.","category":"vegetable","planting":"Asparagus is planted as 1 year old crowns, spaced 30 centimetres apart with 45 centimetres between rows.","component":"growing","shop_link":"asparagus/all/","varieties":"Asparagus varieties differ in harvest time, with some varieties ready for picking in early April, and others available in June and early July.

They grow well in large pots, and given the requirement for heat, this is likely the better option than growing in open ground.\n\nFebruary is a good month to start, planting a few seeds on a sunny windowsill (just like tomatoes).

Standard sized aubergine plants are not overly prolific in the amount of fruit they grow, three to five aubergines per plant is a reasonable return. A small harvest of unusual aubergines is arguably more rewarding after a few months of effort, compared to a handful of fruit that look identical to what can be bought in the shops. \n\nAside from appearance, there are differences in growing characteristics, as some varieties grow faster and are better suited to growing in the UK climate.

Lighter coloured beetroots have the added advantage of a reduced risk of staining your clothes with beetroot juice.\n\nAside from colour, beetroots have different growing and eating characteristics. If you have sandy soil, look for varieties that are â€˜bolt hardyâ€™. This means they are more tolerant of dry conditions and less likely to run to flower before harvest. Some varieties are hardy, and can be left on the plot for longer in autumn and picked when required. This saves the effort, and space, of storing them. \n\nWhen eating beetroot, you may like to grow varieties that have sweeter stems and leaves, ideal for adding interest to salads (young beetroot leaves will be less chewy). Some varieties have flesh that can be eaten raw by grating into salads, whilst others are best cooked or pickled.

They grow at a time of year when there should be plenty of rainfall, thereby avoiding the need to water the seedlings. In later spring, if the weather is warm and dry, topping up with watering when the plants are in flower will help the pods form and swell.\n\nIt is necessary to hoe regularly between the plants as broad beans grow tall without providing ground cover, allowing light to reach the soil to encourage weeds. Except for dwarf types, most varieties will need protection from the wind to avoid them being toppled. The easiest way is to surround the rows with canes, and then use twine or wire to create a â€˜cageâ€™ for them.\n\nThe biggest problem affecting broad beans are aphids, worse in some years than others, but nearly always present. An attack of aphids can look ugly, with masses of aphids smoothering the young shoots and flowers. Before an attack gets really bad, it is best to try and wash them off with water or rub them away between fingers, and repeat as necessary. A mild aphid attack should not prevent a satisfactory harvest.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Planting depth: 3cm beneath soil\n* Planting spacing: plants 9â€³ or 23 cm apart, and the rows about 18â€³ or 45 cm apart","component":"growing","shop_link":"broad-beans/all/","varieties":"Most commonly grown are white and green broad beans, but for interest, you may like to try growing red broad beans. The pods are still green, but the beans inside the pods are red.\n\nFor a spring harvest, look for varieties that can be overwintered. The beans are planted in the autumn, and the small plants survive the winter before accelerating into flower and pods in the following spring. In particularly cold areas, or when very cold weather is predicted, the plants may need covering with a cloche or fleece to protect the plants.\n\nAn alternative to overwintering is to look for varieties of broad beans that can be sown from February onward, or varieties that grow and mature to harvest quickly (although these may have smaller pods). I have found this to be the most reliable method for securing a good harvest on my plot.\n\nIf space is limited, it is possible to plant dwarf varieties of broad beans in pots. If these pots are positioned in a sheltered spot, and seeds are sown successionally, it is possible to achieve a harvest of broad beans over many months. Broad beans freeze very well (blanche in hot water and double pod).","harvesting":"The best time to eat broad beans is as soon as possible after picking. They also freeze very well.

It is sown in the spring and eaten in late summer and autumn. It is slightly more tender and sweet than sprouting broccoli, and forms larger heads for eating.\n* **Sprouting Broccoli**  \nSprouting broccoli is relatively slow growing.

F1 varieties are worth consideration as they are bred for reliability and to harvest earlier in the summer. \n\nSprouting broccoli has a delicious flavour and has a big advantage with the timing of the harvest, as there are not many other vegetables available to pick in the spring. Whilst sprouting broccoli is available to buy in the shops, it is relatively more expensive, and white and purple varieties are seldom seen. By growing sprouting broccoli, a gardener can harvest something difficult to buy. The main disadvantage of sprouting broccoli is the long growing time together with the size of the plants.

Early sprouts should be started this way for a harvest from September onwards. I prefer to wait until warmer weather in April and grow sprouts to be ready for mid winter, and especially for Christmas dinner. \n\nSprouts are slow growing, so many gardeners start the plants in a seed bed or cold frame before transplanting them to their final growing positions when they have a few true leaves. Planting the seedlings through biodegradable fabric will keep weeding to a minimum, and help reduce the need to water in a hot summer. The leaves of brussel sprout plants are subject to being eaten and need to be covered with a net, a tight mesh such as butterfly netting is ideal. The plants should be regularly watered throughout the summer months to keep the soil moist.\n\nIt is a good idea to grow all brassicas together (eg kale, cabbage, broccoli, sprouts) and rotate their position each year. This helps to prevent the build up of diseases that attack the brassica family. It is recommended to dig up the whole plant at the end of the growing season and, rather than throw on the compost heap, burn or dispose of the whole plant.\n\nPicking from the bottom of the plant encourages the sprouts further up the stem to mature. Alternatively, if all the sprouts on a stalk are ready, the whole stalk can be lifted and hung upside down in a cool and dry area (like a shed).

Including varieties, planting, harvesting, photos, and growing tips.","growing":"The growing method is very similar for all types of cabbage, the only difference being the time of year to sow the seed and harvest time. Birds and butterflies love cabbage so a net, and ideally butterfly netting, may be essential to secure a good harvest.\n\nThe basic preparation for planting cabbages is very similar whatever cabbage variety is being grown.\n\nCabbages grow less well in acid soil, preferring a neutral soil with ph 7.0 or around. If a soil testing kit shows you have acidic soil, you may consider adding lime in late winter before preparing the cabbage patch. I have not tested my soil and my cabbages still grow well. You may choose to see how your first crop of cabbages grows, and then investigate further with a soil testing kit if you are disappointed with the results.   \n\nBefore planting, improve the growing bed. Cabbages like a rich, well dug soil. Like most things that grow big, cabbages are hungry, so the more well rotted manure or compost that can be added to the soil the better. The reward is a bigger harvest.  \n\nStart cabbages in a seed bed or seed tray with a plan to transplant. Cabbage roots do not like being disturbed, so care is needed to ensure the minimum disturbance to the root ball. Also, it is important to ensure that newly relocated seedlings are watered regularly to establish themselves.  \n\nWhen transplanting cabbages this is an ideal time to place â€˜collarsâ€™ around their base to deter root fly. I do not do this. Instead, I prefer to plant my cabbages through biodegradable weed guard. This helps to minimise weeding. Cabbage is relatively slow growing providing ample opportunity for weeds to grow. Weed guard also provides some defence against cabbage root fly.\n\nAllow plenty of space between cabbages to encourage strong growth. Give cabbage plants a good dousing of water regularly as plants can bolt in hot weather. Also, healthy plants grow bigger leaves and heads, and they are more resistant to pests. Watering once a week in dry spells is a minimum.\n\nRotate the location of your cabbages each year. This is best practice for all vegetable growing anyway, but is particularly important at the allotment where it is likely cabbages have been grown for years, with the associated build up of potential pests and diseases.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Planting depth: 1.5 cm\n* Planting spacing: 45 cm between plants and rows","component":"growing","shop_link":"cabbages/all/","varieties":"Cabbage can be grown all year round and there are many different types, colours, and shapes. Varieties of cabbage range from white flesh to red and purple types, and from loose leaf to pointed and large ball head varieties. Perhaps the most important distinction is the time of year different cabbage varieties are harvested.\n\nThe large range of cabbage types can be confusing. My preference is to concentrate on growing winter cabbages, as summer cabbages occupy space that can be used for faster growing salad crops, and slow growing spring cabbage seems a long time to wait.\n\n### Spring Cabbage\n\nTypically spring cabbages are of the loose leaf type and they are also referred to as spring greens. An easy method for germination is to use seed trays with plastic dividers for individual seeds. When the seedlings are large enough to handle they can be planted out into their final growing position. Care is needed to ensure that they do not mature too early in autumn, or alternatively are too small to survive the onset of winter. One way of mitigating the risk is to sow seedlings in batches two weeks apart.\n\n### Summer Cabbage\n\nThese are typically pointed or ball head cabbage varieties (which are excellent for coleslaw). They are best started early under cover in February ready for planting out in March or April. As these varieties need to develop their fleshy leaves through the summer months, it is essential to provide them with sufficient water.\n\n### Winter Cabbage\n\nThe famous savoy cabbages with their wrinkled or curly leaves are ideal for winter harvesting. Winter cabbage is quite slow to grow, so I prefer to start the seeds in a seed tray in April or May and transplant to their final growing position when they have matured to show two full adult leaves. Transplanting the seedlings provides the opportunity to give them the correct spacing and protection. Winter cabbage is extremely hardy. The plants can be left in their growing position overwinter and harvested when you want to eat them.","harvesting":"* March to December\n* Eat fresh.

From year two onwards, carrots can be much harder to grow as a carrot fly attack can spoil a crop, resulting in ugly black wounds on the flesh of the carrots. The remedy is to grow the carrots at height, for example in barrels, troughs, or large pots (carrot flies are low flying) or protected by insect netting.\n\nDo not overwater carrots as their long roots penetrate deep into the soil. Watering on a weekly basis is likely sufficient to keep enough moisture in the soil for the roots to swell to a good size. The distinctive feathery leaves of carrots make them easy to identify. Their low height encourages weeds to grow around them, and these should be removed regularly to keep the bed weed free.\n\nIt is easy to check whether carrots are nearing full size by gently brushing away some top soil, although their full length is only visible by digging up. Rather than harvesting all the crop at once, carrots are pulled up as required. \n\nCarrots keep well, and if the soil is not too wet, the crop can be left in the ground through winter until needed.

If left for too long, the curds (the flesh) will burst, looking like an uneven head that will soon discolour and start to separate.\n\nSimilar to other brassicas, cauliflower leaves are loved by birds, especially pigeons, who will happily munch on them and potentially strip them back to their stalks. Cabbage white butterflies like to lay their eggs on the leaves, which will start to be eaten as soon as the caterpillars hatch. The solution is to cover the plants with butterfly netting, ensuring there is sufficient clearance to avoid either birds or butterflies reaching the leaves from outside of the net.\n\nCauliflowers are ready to harvest when they form a head at the centre of the plant, and the leaves covering the head start to open, revealing the cauliflower within.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Planting depth: 0.5 cm covered by a fine layer of compost\n* Planting spacing: 60 cm between plants and rows","component":"growing","shop_link":"cauliflowers/all/","varieties":"There are two main varieties of cauliflower, the more commonly grown summer types which are planted in the spring and picked from July onwards, and those sown later in the summer to overwinter and provide a spring harvest.","harvesting":"* Spring varieties from April to June\n* Summer and autumn varieties from mid-June to September","hero_image":{"id":"","url":"","linktype":"story","fieldtype":"multilink","cached_url":""},"lead_image":{"id":3662376,"alt":"mature cauliflower","name":"","focus":null,"title":"","filename":"https://a.storyblok.com/f/136863/1200x630/8fb6de309d/mature-cauliflower.jpg","copyright":"","fieldtype":"asset"},"introduction":"It may come as a surprise, but cauliflowers come in a range of colours and not simply the creamy white heads found in supermarkets, including varieties that form yellow, purple, and green heads.\n\nCompared to other brassicas like broccoli and cabbage, cauliflower is relatively difficult to grow.

It is best to plant them out as soon as it is safe to do so. The longer the growing season, the more time the crowns have to swell to a large size. The crowns should be level with the surface of the soil and not buried.\n\nThe plants may need covering with a net to stop birds nibbling the leaves, and they should be watered regularly. When the crowns (actually a swollen part of the stem) start to mature, it is suggested to remove the sideways growing leaves to focus the plants energy on the crown. Leaves growing directly upwards should be left on the plant. \n\nCeleriac has relative few pests, but can be eaten by slugs and snails.\n\nBy late August or early September the crowns should be large enough to eat.

Including varieties, planting, harvesting, photos, and growing tips.","growing":"Courgettes usually grow in a bush shape, with their fruit centred in the middle of the plant protected by the leaves above and around them. They are big plants with a spread of about 1 metre, and they require plenty of water whilst setting fruit. There are dwarf varieties available, but in general, courgettes are best planted in open ground where they have plenty of soil and space to grow.\n\nLike many squash varieties, courgettes do not like cold weather, but sowing late in the season is not a problem. Courgettes grow vigorously,  so even sowing in late April (perhaps in a pot on a sunny windowsill) or direct outside in May when there is no chance of a late frost, will allow ample time to enjoy a bumper harvest from July onwards.\n\nThe leaves of young courgette plants are a delicacy for slugs and snails. To stop them being eaten, I grow my courgette seedlings as large as possible in pots on a shelf away from risk of attack. When the plants are larger their leaves are much less prone to being eaten, and are safe to be planted out in their final growing postions.\n\nI like to plant out seedlings with a slight concave depression surrounding the plant, so that water naturally flows toward it during watering. In the planting hole, I add a rich mixture of manure and compost underneath the seedling. Courgettes are very greedy plants.\n\nWhen a courgette plant is in robust health it has the potential to shoot out flowers and courgettes at a rate faster than it is possible to eat. I now plan for only two courgette plants for my family, but grow an additional two plants as a precaution against loss.\n\nCourgettes are best picked when they are between 10-20 centimetres in length. At this size they have their best flavour and most soft skin. Picking early also encourages more fruit to develop. When the courgette plant is in peak health, baby courgettes can swell extremely quickly into a size more like a marrow. In wet weather, you may need to keep a daily eye on the courgettes if you want to pick them at the perfect size.\n\nBy late summer, it is common for courgettes to experience powdery mildew on their leaves. My experience is that this is nothing to worry about, as although it indicates the plant is past its best, by that stage of the summer it can come as a relief not to have any more courgettes to eat!","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Sow in warm conditions (propagator or windowsill)\n* Planting depth: 2.5 cm\n* Planting spacing: 90 cm between plants, 90 cm between rows","component":"growing","shop_link":"courgettes/all/","varieties":"Shops often sell one type of courgette, the straight green variety.

Once the plants are established in midsummer, and provided they are well watered and the fruit is picked young, each plant can produce several courgettes a week.

This is the easiest and most successful way to grow them, as cucumbers are tender plants that enjoy warm conditions. However, only outdoor types are likely to be successful outside, and they should be sown in sheltered and sunny locations.\n\nThe time to sow seed is different depending on whether the cucumber varieties are indoor or outdoor types. Indoor varieties can be sown from February, with the first cucumbers ready from June onwards. Outdoor varieties are sown later from April, with the first harvest towards the end of July.\n\nI plant my cucumber seeds length ways 1.5 cm deep on their ridges in already moist soil, cover with cling film, and then place on a warm windowsill to encourage germination. When cucumbers are seedlings, avoid over watering as this can kill the plants.\n\nCucumbers are like other members of the squash family in that they grow best in a rich soil that should be kept moist throughout the growing season.\n\nDepending on the variety, cucumbers can produce both male and female flowers. The key difference is that the male flowers do not have baby fruit growing behind them. It is recommended to:\n\n* Pinch out the male flowers if growing cucumbers indoors  \n(this helps stop the fruit becoming bitter)\n* Leave the male flowers on outdoor growing cucumbers\n\nIt is possible to buy cucumber seeds cultivated to only produce female flowers. This is more expensive, but a good option for a busy or inexperienced gardener.\n\nWhen cucumbers are in flower they should be watered regularly to ensure the soil is moist. At this stage, the plant is safe from the danger of over watering, providing their pot or soil has reasonable drainage.\n\nCucumbers are best picked at their ideal length (which varies according to the type of cucumber) and not left on the plants to become overripe. Overripe cucumbers have thicker skin and larger seeds inside the fruit. Picking frequently will encourage more cucumbers to set.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Sow in a warm environment (propagator or windowsill)\n* Planting depth: 1.5 cm\n* Planting spacing: Individual pots, or 60 cm between plants, 60 cm between rows","component":"growing","shop_link":"cucumbers/all/","varieties":"Cucumbers are typically divided into indoor and outdoor types, with indoor types having smooth skins (like those seen in the shops), whilst outdoor cucumber varieties have ridged skins and prickles.

Alternatively, the plants can be sown earlier indoors using coco fibre or biodegradable pots (to avoid disturbing the roots when transplanting), but this method does run the risk of the plants bolting.\n\nThe best conditions are warm summers combined with regular watering â€“ growing through biodegradable weed fabric helps keep the soil warm and moist.\n\nThin the seedlings to 30 centimetres or 12 inches apart.

Early sowings need protection, and only planted out after all risk of frost has passed. The big advantage of French beans over runner beans is that French beans are stringless. The pods should be picked young when they are about 10 centimetres in length, after which the skin starts to harden. During the flowering and harvesting season, ensure the plants are well watered as this will increase harvest size.\n\nYou may decide to allow your French bean pods to mature to harvest the beans themselves. The immature beans are sometimes called flageolets, whilst the mature beans are known as haricots. It is important to remember that all beans contain toxins in both the beans and the pods. The beans are edible, but they must be cooked by boiling vigorously for at least 10 minutes to remove toxins that can cause food poisoning (like red kidney beans), and then simmer longer to soften. Dried beans may have more toxins than fresh beans, and will need additional soaking for 12-24 hours before cooking.\n\nYoung French bean pods have less toxins than mature beans, but they should always be cooked and not eaten raw*. \n\n*This is an introduction to cooking French beans, the amount of toxins will differ per variety so you may want to check this before growing (and cooking), or follow a recipe from a trusted source.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Sow seed in a warm and light environment (propagator, windowsill, greenhouse)\n* Planting depth: 2 cm or 1 inch\n* Plant spacing: 25cm or 9 inches between plants, rows spaced 45 cm or 19 inches (dwarf), 60 cm or 2 feet (standard)","component":"growing","shop_link":"french-beans/all/","varieties":"French beans are a space saving crop because they grow upwards.

For this reason, you may like to grow different varieties of dwarf varieties, or sow them in two waves, to extend the harvest period.","harvesting":"* Pick the pods young when between 10 â€“ 13 cm length (dwarf) or 15 â€“ 18 cm length (regular)\n* See notes below on the importance of cooking pods and beans","hero_image":{"id":"","url":"","linktype":"story","fieldtype":"multilink","cached_url":""},"lead_image":{"id":3667986,"alt":"French beans ready for picking","name":"","focus":null,"title":"","filename":"https://a.storyblok.com/f/136863/1200x630/7ca1c93b4f/mature-french-beans.jpg","copyright":"","fieldtype":"asset"},"introduction":"French beans produce wonderful ornate flowers that go on to form edible bean pods.

Both will happily munch through the leaves, striping the plants back to their stalks. A great feature of kale is its ability to recover from an attack. New leaves will grow from the centre of the plant, and it is this characteristic that enables the gardener to pick kale leaves over many months. To protect from wildlife, kale should be covered with a butterfly net.\n\nLike other plants grown for their leaves, kale should be watered regularly. This helps plants grow more vigorously and the leaves to be less chewy. \n\nKale can grow up to 1 metre in height with a bushy habit. This helps block light reaching the ground, reducing the amount of weeding and helping the ground retain moisture. However, when the plants are small, the kale bed will need regular weeding.\n\nThe most tasty kale leaves are the small young leaves, which can even be enjoyed raw. Larger leaves can be steamed and added to stir fries or other cooked dishes. I always remove the chewy stalk that runs up the centre of the leaves by cutting vertically down the leaves with a sharp knife.\n\nKale is typically harvested by ripping a few leaves off a number of plants, allowing the harvest season to spread over many months. Sustaining two or three plants is usually enough for a family, and allows room in the kale bed for other brassicas like cabbage, sprouts, or broccoli. Growing brassicas together in the same bed helps make crop rotation easier.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Sow seeds protected by a cold frame, polytunnel, or unheated greenhouse\n* Planting depth: 1 cm or half an inch\n* When transplanting space plants 45 cm apart in all directions","component":"growing","shop_link":"kale/all/","varieties":"There is a wide range of kale varieties to choose from, including splendidly colourful red and purple varieties that are seldom seen in supermarkets.

The leaves attract white flies, and the occasional caterpillar, and these are much easier to spot and wash away when the leaves are not curly.","harvesting":"* Take leaves from several plants (rather than dig up a whole plant)\n* The plants will grow back leaves, providing a harvest over several months","hero_image":{"id":"","url":"","linktype":"story","fieldtype":"multilink","cached_url":""},"lead_image":{"id":3671882,"alt":"mature kale plants","name":"","focus":null,"title":"","filename":"https://a.storyblok.com/f/136863/1200x630/d5c895e355/mature-kale-plants.jpg","copyright":"","fieldtype":"asset"},"introduction":"Kale is packed full of nutrition containing relatively high amounts of vitamins and antioxidants.

Including varieties, planting, harvesting, photos, and growing tips.","growing":"Leeks are the largest member of the allium family that includes onions, garlic, and chives. Rather than form a bulb, their leaves grow straight upwards wrapped tightly around each other to create what looks like a stalk, but isnâ€™t.\n\nLeeks are easy to grow and will mature to harvest in a wide range of soil types. They do not take up a lot of space in a garden or allotment, and can be grown relatively close together and tolerate some shade. Their ideal growing conditions are rich soils that have had well rotted compost mixed in, with a soil that holds moisture but is free draining (ie no puddles). In these conditions, leeks will develop longer stems and mature faster.\n\nLeeks need a little warmth to get going, so the best time to sow leeks is after the weather turns warmer in spring, or earlier if you have a greenhouse. They should be sown in a seed tray, or in a plastic pot, so that they can be easily cared for before they are ready to be planted out.\n\nWhen the seedlings are about 15 centimetres or 6 inches tall, they are ready for planting in their final growing positions. To save weeding, I plant the seedlings though holes cut into biodegradable weed fabric. To grow longer white stems, I create cylindrical holes in the ground about 15 centimetres or 6 inches deep, by pushing the handle of a hand trowel down into the soil. One leek seedling is placed in each hole, before filling the hole with water to help bed the roots in wet soil. Every few days following planting, I add water to the holes until the plants look established (upright stems and growing).\n\nIf growing in open soil, the bed will need regularly hoeing to eliminate weed growth and to ensure the leeks get the maximum light and moisture available. Notwithstanding this, leeks are very easy to take care of. There is no need to water them during the summer months, unless it is exceptionally dry, and they have very few diseases, or bugs that eat them. If you notice any flower stems (leaves with buds on) these should be removed.\n\nI like to leave a plant or two on the plot to produce flowers in early summer. Leeks produce large beautiful flowers that are good to look at, and loved by bees.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Sow seeds in a seed tray or seed bed 1 cm deep to germinate (outdoors)\n* Transplant to final growing position in holes 6 inches deep (water in)\n* Planting spacing: 15 cm between leeks, 25 cm between rows","component":"growing","shop_link":"leeks/all/","varieties":"There are two main types of leeks: early and late varieties.

Typically, early varieties are smaller but have a faster growth cycle, whilst later varieties take longer to mature and are harvested through winter and early spring. Newer varieties of leeks have been introduced, sometimes as hybrid F1 types, that combine the advantages of both.\n\nThe main choice facing a gardener is the timing of the harvest. My preference is to grow leeks for winter and spring picking, rather than for a late summer and early autumn crop. My reasoning is that in late summer there are many other vegetables available for harvest, including garlic, onions, and shallots. In winter, and especially early spring, there are far fewer crops available. Leeks come into their own during this period, as they are extremely hardy and can be left standing on the plot until needed.","harvesting":"* Early varieties will mature more quickly for a harvest in late summer and autumn\n* Late varieties will mature in autumn for harvesting through winter and early spring.","hero_image":{"id":"","url":"","linktype":"story","fieldtype":"multilink","cached_url":""},"lead_image":{"id":3672443,"alt":"freshly picked leeks","name":"","focus":null,"title":"","filename":"https://a.storyblok.com/f/136863/1200x630/4f3dcb00c0/freshly-picked-leeks.jpg","copyright":"","fieldtype":"asset"},"introduction":"Leeks are one of the most traditional, easy to grow, and delicious vegetables to be found on allotments.\n\nThey grow in nearly all soil types â€“ but grow biggest in rich soils â€“ and are relatively disease free and extremely hardy.

Also, I invariably sowed more seed than I needed, and when I thinned the seedlings to create the correct spacing I was effectively throwing away seed. \n\nBy contrast, planting a pot with four or five seeds is very quick to do at home, where I can easily keep an eye on the plants every day (and water as required).

These are miniature onions that are simply pushed into the prepared ground at planting time, leaving their tip just poking through the surface.\n\nCover freshly planted onion sets with a net. Birds will not eat the sets, but they do have an annoying habit of pulling them up. I assume they do this to check what they are, and to see if they are edible.\n\nApart from needing to hoe in between onions to keep weeds under control, onions are one of the easiest vegetables on the allotment to care for. After the sets have germinated, any protective nets can be removed as the birds will no longer be a problem.\n\nOnions do not require constant watering. Some people even say that too much watering can spoil their flavour. In normal summer weather, I will leave them to grow naturally. In prolonged absence of summer rain showers, I may give them a good soaking to tide them over (once a week). In extreme hot weather they may need watering every 3 or 4 days.\n\nWhen onion leaves start to turn yellow and fall over they are ready for picking. \n\nTo store onions, they need to dry out first. After picking, they can be left on top of the soil for a day or two if the weather is hot. Alternatively, spread the onions out on a large table or shelf for a few days.

The big difference is that growing parsnips is much easier. \n\nParsnips can be affected by carrot fly and canker, but often to a much lesser extent than carrots. Both problems build up where parsnips are grown often, and is common on allotments. The best solution if crops are affected is to find a fresh location to grow them. There are also hybrid F1 varieties that have been bred to show resistance to these problems.\n\nOn my plot, which has loose sandy soil, I find it best to sow parsnip seeds direct into the soil in early spring, just when the weather starts to improve. If the weather is cold, for example regularly below 10 Â°C  in the daytime, I wait longer. When warm spring air arrives, the soil should be moist for many weeks, giving sufficient encouragement to parsnip seeds to germinate. Attempting to germinate parsnip seed in hot dry conditions is notoriously unreliable.\n\nAfter sowing, if there is no rain, I will regularly water the parsnip rows every few days to keep the soil moist.\n\nThe slow growing nature of parsnips means that the beds will need constant weeding. Luckily, the distinctive leaf shape of parsnips makes the seedlings easy to distinguish. Once the plants start to grow strongly, they can be thinned to the correct distance according to the variety chosen. \n\nAt this stage, watering is less of an issue, as parsnips send roots deep into the ground to find moisture. Parsnip rows will only require watering in very dry periods.\n\nThe sweetness of parsnips improves with the onset of cold weather, as a sharp ground frost will increase their sugar content. Parsnips are hardy vegetables and will keep for many months through winter in the soil where they grew, and dug up when required. If this is the intention, remember to clearly mark the location of the parsnips, as the above ground vegetation will die away.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Planting depth: 1 cm\n* Planting spacing: thin to 15 cm between plants, 30 cm between a pair of rows (45 cm between pairs)","component":"growing","shop_link":"parsnips/all/","varieties":"There is often not a large choice of parsnip varieties to be found in shops.

Peas do not germinate well in cold and wet soil, so it is best to wait until the weather warms in the spring before planting outdoors. \n\nFor an early sowing in February, peas can be protected using plastic cloches or inside a plastic greenhouse or polytunnel. It is also possible to sow peas in the autumn for overwintering to provide a spring harvest. If doing this, the peas will need the protection of a cloche or plastic grow tunnel.\n\nProtected young pea plants from birds is essential to achieve a harvest. The sweet tasting leaves of young plants are loved by birds, and pigeons in particular. Without a net, once the plants have been found by birds, it is likely that their leaves will be completely stripped off, setting the plants back considerably or killing them altogether.\n\nThe easiest types of pea to grow are mangetout and sugar snap varieties, which are eaten as whole pods rather than shelled for their peas. Mangetout varieties are eaten when the pods are formed, at about three inches or 7.5 centimetres in length, but with the pods still flat. Sugar snap varieties are eaten when the peas are fully formed inside the pods.\n\nFreshly sown peas should germinate within three weeks in the spring, or two weeks in the summer, provided that they are well protected. With good luck, the peas should really start to get going with the warmer spring weather. They do not need protection from the cold, but regular watering is important to ensure that the ground never dries out (over watering may result in too much leaf growth).\n\nWhen the plants unfurl their flowers, it is time to step up the watering, to help swell the pods and encourage more flowers to set. Pods should be picked as soon as they mature, as this will encourage the plants to carry on being productive and provide a bigger and longer harvest period.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Planting depth: 5 cm\n* Planting spacing: 10 cm between plants, 45 cm between rows","component":"growing","shop_link":"peas/all/","varieties":"There are many varieties of peas to choose from including early and maincrop types, and the delicious and sweet tasting mangetout and sugar snap varieties. Early types are sometimes divided into first earlies and second earlies, the main difference being the time the plants take to harvest, with first earlies (as the name suggests) providing their crop approximately two weeks before second earlies. First earlies take approximately 3 months to reach harvest, whereas maincrop varieties need an extra month.\n\nPeas are also described as round or wrinkled, which relates to the appearance of the seed. The smooth round peas are said to be more hardy. In practice, many gardeners wait until the weather warms up before planting either type.\n\nThere are dwarf varieties of peas available. Whereas standard peas are natural climbers, and therefore require tying to supports like a waist high wigwam frame, dwarf varieties grow up to 45 centimetres and only need simpler supports like upright canes. Dwarf varieties are great where space is limited, and grow well in pots and containers.","harvesting":"* Pick regularly to encourage more flowers to set\n* Eat fresh, or alternatively shell, blanch, and freeze","hero_image":{"id":"","url":"","linktype":"story","fieldtype":"multilink","cached_url":""},"lead_image":{"id":3673587,"alt":"peas ready for picking","name":"","focus":null,"title":"","filename":"https://a.storyblok.com/f/136863/1200x630/cd70ebba8d/peas-ready-for-picking.jpg","copyright":"","fieldtype":"asset"},"introduction":"Peas are one of the best vegetables to start growing, as the reward of eating raw freshly picked peas is magnificent, and popular amongst all members of a family â€“ even the youngest.\n\nYet growing peas can also be a little challenging: birds love them; they require support; germination can be hit and miss; and they require frequent watering at key periods to produce a bumper crop.","paid_or_free":"paid","seo_description":"A complete guide to growing peas at home or an allotment.

Including varieties, planting, harvesting, photos, and growing tips.","growing":"Having a healthy back is a good starting point for planting potatoes. Potatoes like a well dug soil, and the ideal approach is to spend a few hours digging trenches for a potato bed.\n\nThis effort has a number of advantages. It breaks up the soil, and allows young potato tubers to form without being misshapen by lumps or large stones. It buries all weeds that may be present in the potato bed. And, of course, it is excellent exercise after a winter rest! Another advantage of deep trenches (around a spade deep) is that it allows seed potatoes a period of growth below ground, after which any risk of frost has usually passed. The deep trench with loose soil provides an ideal space for the potato tubers to grow in.\n\nI like to generously space apart the rows of potatoes. Potato plants grow big, and it is helpful to allow some space between the rows to walk down for watering and weeding. Also, potato plants need to be earthed up, and this earth needs to come from somewhere. I find the easiest way is to â€˜borrow itâ€™ from the ground either side of the trench. If there is not enough space between rows, there will not be enough soil to earth up with.\n\nHaving space also makes a difference at harvest time. Digging up potatoes means that the displaced earth needs to be put somewhere. If it can be piled up between the rows of potatoes, this makes the process easier.\n\nPotatoes do not like a waterlogged soil, but the tubers will not grow to a big size without regular watering. A rule of thumb is to soak the trenches of the freshly planted potatoes on day 1 of planting, and then water once a week in hot weather, or every two weeks otherwise. I have learned the importance of doing this through experience, as potatoes growing in dry soil may never swell beyond the size of marbles.\n\nWhen the potato plants are 30 cm high, this is the ideal time to start earthing them up. The purpose of earthing up is to eliminate all light from reaching the tubers growing beneath the soil. Potatoes turn green, and poisonous, if they have been exposed to sunlight and they must not be eaten. When storing potatoes, it is important to exclude all light for the same reason. I take soil from between the rows of potatoes, and carefully pile this up the sides of the potato plants.\n\nAfter a few more weeks, and the odd good watering, the potato plants become even more self-sufficient. Hoeing between the plants no longer becomes necessary as the plants thicken. Soon after you will see flowers, followed by the production of green berries. Like with green potatoes,  the berries are poisonous, so you may want to remove them or advise children to leave them well alone. Flowers and berries are also an indicator that potato tubers are swelling below the ground, and means it is a very good time to give the plants a thorough soaking with water.\n\nWith luck and good weather, the potato plants will continue to mature, before eventually wilting and turning yellow, which marks the end to their growth cycle, and showing that their delicious produce below ground is fully grown and ready for harvesting.\n\nTo harvest, I prefer to use a combination of a garden spade to dig down around the plants to the depth of where I believe the tubers should be, and then scramble through the dirt using my gardening gloves to find the potatoes. This method minimises the risk of damaging the tubers with a fork or hand trowel.\n\nThe final task of the summer is to return the potato bed to a flat and level surface ready for the next growing season. It is recommended to keep rotating the growing bed of potato plants, ideally not returning to the same spot until the fourth year.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Planting depth: 15 cm\n* Planting spacing: 40 cm between plants, 100 cm between rows (minimum)","component":"growing","shop_link":"potatoes/all/","varieties":"All potato types are planted in the spring. The difference is that early varieties are more tolerant of colder weather, mature faster, and require a little less space between plants. Main crop potatoes are planted a little later, take longer to mature, but typically produce bigger potatoes.\n\n### First Earlies\n\nFrom sowing to harvesting this is can be as little as ten weeks. They can be planted in trenches about 30 cm or 12â€³ apart, and with 50 cm between the rows. They are harvested when the plants are about to flower. Start by digging up one plant and, if the potatoes are of sufficient size, you know they are ready.\n\n### Second Earlies\n\nSecond earlies take significantly longer to grow â€“ around 16 -18 weeks â€“ and are larger is size than first earlies. Allow a little more space between the tubers and rows than first earlies, and wait for the plants to flower and wilt, or yellow a little, before digging up.\n\n### Main Crop\n\nThe recommended spacing is around 40 cm or 15â€³ apart and rows around 75 cm apart. Time to harvest is about 20 weeks. Main crop potatoes are the type to choose if you intend to store for winter use.\n\n### Salad Potatoes\n\nThese are varieties grown for culinary use in salads. The potatoes are typically smaller than other types, and do not disintegrate or flake away during boiling. This property for retaining their shape makes them ideal for serving as boiled potatoes or served cold in salads (and less good for mash and roast potatoes).\n\nIn addition, potatoes are sometimes described as being floury or waxy.\n\n### Floury Potatoes\n\nFloury potatoes have a tendency to fall apart when boiling. This property is ideal for mashed potatoes, and for absorbing fat and crisping up when making chips or roast potatoes.\n\n### Waxy Potatoes\n\nWaxy potatoes hold their shape better than floury potatoes. Waxy potatoes make great boiled potatoes or salad potatoes, but they do not mash well.","harvesting":"* Dig up as required in early summer, and dig up all potatoes by September\n* Dry potatoes and store in thick cardboard boxes or bags, excluding all light","hero_image":{"id":"","url":"","linktype":"story","fieldtype":"multilink","cached_url":""},"lead_image":{"id":3673767,"alt":"","name":"","focus":null,"title":"freshly dug potatoes","filename":"https://a.storyblok.com/f/136863/1200x630/d93b31da88/freshly-dug-potatoes.jpg","copyright":"","fieldtype":"asset"},"introduction":"Growing potatoes is not difficult to do, but does involve significant work at the beginning preparing the potato bed, and at the end harvesting the crop and clearing up.

Including varieties, planting, harvesting, photos, and growing tips.","growing":"Runner beans like a loose soil, as their roots dive down deeply to search for nutrients and water. They will grow best in a rich soil full of well rotted compost or manure, although in my experience they have always grown well wherever I have put them. It is recommended to prepare your runner bean bed the autumn before, digging a deep trench and mixing in rich compost.\n\nRunner beans germinate easily and reliably. If sowing direct into the soil, plant two per bean pole and pinch out the weakest if both germinate. It is worth keeping a few pot germinated plants in reserve. Snails love runner beans, and you may find that you plant several replacements before the seedlings mature sufficiently to escape this threat.\n\nMy preferred way of growing runner beans is to create an A frame around two rows of bean poles 50 cm apart, with the poles spaced 30 cm apart. The beans may need a little encouragement to find the poles, and I loosely tie the young plants to the poles using twine. Once they have found the poles there is no stopping them.\n\nRunner beans are a naturally vigorous plant and in hot weather they will grow quickly â€“ provided their roots never dry out. It is best to avoid over watering when the plants are young as this may encourage them to become â€˜bushyâ€™ with too many leaves. As soon as you can see flowers, it is the ideal time to start to water regularly. Applying a thick mulch will help conserve water in the soil and suppress weeds.\n\nWhen the plants have reached the top of their support, pinch out the growing tips. Left unchecked, a runner bean plant can easily grow to 2.5 metres in height, so diverting the energy into flowers and pod development will help boost the harvest.\n\nThe pods are best picked young, before they develop â€˜stringinessâ€™. The faster you cook them after picking, the more of the natural sugars you will enjoy. Otherwise these sugars will turn to starch. If you have a glut of beans, it is worth picking them young and freezing them (or giving them to appreciative friends and family) rather than letting them harden and mature on the bush.","category":"vegetable","planting":"* Planting depth: 5 cm\n* Planting spacing: 25 cm between plants, 50 cm between rows","component":"growing","shop_link":"runner-beans/all/","varieties":"Runner beans are a popular vegetable to grow, with a choice of red or white flowered varieties that produce delicate flowers from July onwards that herald the setting of the bean pods. The beautiful flowers are a sufficient reason to grow the vegetable, providing a dramatic cascade of colour as the plants grow up wigwams or other supports, whether on an allotment or at home in a vegetable garden. There are also dwarf varieties of runner beans suitable for growing in pots on a patio.\n\nRunner beans are typically eaten young when the bean pods are at about 25 centimetres or 8 inches in length, before the beans have started to swell inside the pods and the shell of the pods have started to yellow. The bean pods are topped and tailed, and then cut into two centimetre, or one inch slices, and added to stir fries, pasta dishes, soups, curries, and casseroles.\n\nWhen eating and preparing runner beans, a common problem is the pods developing strings along the outside edges that make them less enjoyable to eat. There are runner bean varieties that are bred to avoid this problem and are referred to as â€˜stringlessâ€™ varieties. Strings can also be avoided by picking the pods young. Picking young bean pods will also encourage the plants to set more beans, increasing the size of the harvest.\n\nRunner beans are originally from South America, and are frost sensitive plants that will not survive cold nights. However, runner beans perform less well in hot dry summers, as although the plants may flower, hot nights may considerably reduce the number of flowers that set bean pods. To help overcome this problem, runner bean varieties have been developed that have been crossed with French beans (that are more reliable). Self pollinating varieties of runner beans can have higher conversion rates of flowers setting bean pods, leading to larger harvests. In dry summers, watering bean plants at night to avoid dry roots can boost harvest size.\n\nIf left on the plant, runner beans will mature inside the pods to provide seed for next yearâ€™s harvest. The beans are edible, but they must be cooked by boiling vigorously for at least 10 minutes to remove toxins that can cause food poisoning (like red kidney beans), and then simmer longer to soften. Dried beans may have more toxins than fresh beans, and will need additional soaking for 12-24 hours before cooking. Young bean pods have less toxins than mature beans, but it is always advisable to cook runner beans thoroughly (by following a recipe from a trusted source) and never eat them raw. This is an introduction to cooking runner beans, the amount of toxins will differ per variety so you may want to check this before growing (and cooking).","harvesting":"* Young pods have superior taste, older pods develop strings\n* Pick and cook straight away for the best flavour, alternatively blanch and freeze","hero_image":{"id":"","url":"","linktype":"story","fieldtype":"multilink","cached_url":""},"lead_image":{"id":3467288,"alt":"Runner bean ready for harvest","name":"","focus":null,"title":"","filename":"https://a.storyblok.com/f/136863/1200x630/f546c8cc1b/runner-bean-varieties.jpg","copyright":"","fieldtype":"asset"},"introduction":"Runner beans are one of the most beautiful sites on a vegetable garden in July and August.
