    "description": "DEVELOPED BY JAMES WONG - James is an enthusiastic Kew trained botanist, RHS award winner, author and TV presenter who is renowned for thinking outside of the box when it comes to exciting and unusual fruit and vegetable varieties to grow at home.  Already a firm favourite amongst James&#39; fans and gracing the dishes of many a TV chef, these tiny watermelons lookalikes have a refreshing flavour and bags of personality. Plus, their lush vines will produce masses of fruit throughout the summer with a ‚Äòcucumber and lime‚Äô taste, Ready when they are grape-sized and still firm to the touch. Try in salads, pickled whole, or why not explore their cocktail-enhancing prowess? Easy to grow. Vigorous climber/trailer. Pest and drought resistant. Origin: Mexico. Latin name: Melothria scabra.  These tiny watermelon look-a-likes from Central America are small enough to fit into a teaspoon, yet bite into one and the flavour is pure cucumber with a fresh tinge of lime. Popular since pre-Columbian times, these rampant trailing vines produce a constant stream of fruit throughout the summer, known in Mexico as ‚ÄòSand√≠itas de Raton‚Äô, literally ‚ÄúLittle Mouse Watermelons‚Äù. Despite their exotic origins and adorable appearance, they are much easier to grow than regular cucumbers. They are ignored by pests, resistant to drought & perfectly happy to grow outdoors in the UK, given a sheltered sunny site. Tastes like: Cucumber and lime.  Cucamelons can also be treated like a perennial providing you with fruit year-after-year. In late autumn once the fruiting period is over, lift the cucamelon&#39;s main radish like root and store in barely moist compost in a garage or shed over winter. Plant out again in early April to achieve early fruiting. Sow: April-May. Harvest: July-September.  For more information on growing cucamelon from seed, read our growing guide here  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†",

    "description": "Developed by James Wong - Believe it or not, these pretty little daisy flowers have a big surprise - they taste like citrus with a jolt of electricity! Their fizzy electric buzz effect is like nothing you will have tasted before. Similar to popping candy, cloves, or a 9 volt battery, this unusual sensation is perfect for spicing up your cooking, bringing an unexpected zing to a dessert or sorbet, or adding a mouth-tingling twist to a glamorous cocktail. Stunning as bedding plants in any garden. Snip flowers off when they reach full colour, but only try a few petals! The more you snip, the more flowers will come. Origin: Brazil. Latin name: Acmella oleracea. Tastes like: Citrus with a jolt of electricity!  Pop one of these unassuming little yellow flowers in your mouth and you will soon find out how it got its range of colourful common names; everything from ‚Äòbuzz buttons‚Äô to ‚Äòtoothache plant‚Äô. An initial burst of citrus tang is quickly followed by a curious, tingly sensation - like a jolt of electricity - that fills your whole mouth, ending in a mild local anaesthesia that can last for up to 15 minutes!  This fizzy ‚Äòspace dust‚Äô-like effect - which some have likened to licking a 9 volt battery - is produced by the plant‚Äôs high levels of a pain-relieving agent called spilanthol, explaining its traditional use in treating toothache, mouth ulcers & sore throats for centuries. Spilanthol&#39;s muscle relaxing effects have even meant that an extract of the plant has found its way into high-end face creams that claim to have a natural &#39;botox&#39; effect. Sow: March-April. Harvest: June-October.  ¬†  ¬†",

We‚Äôve selected this variety, specifically bred for its larger fruit yields in the UK. Highly productive. Delicious & foolproof to grow. Sky high in antioxidants. The eastern &#39;superfood&#39; that‚Äôs easier to grow than a stinging nettle. Tastes like: Malt, tomato, cranberry.¬†Origin: China. Latin name: Lycium barbarum.  The goji berry bush is a perennial plant and as such will continue to produce fruits each year. You might be surprised to learn that the exotic Himalayan Goji Berry lives a secret double life as a common, and quite often very invasive, weed throughout much of the UK. Highly productive, delicious and foolproof to grow, before planting one of these it is actually even worth double checking that it hasn‚Äôt already planted itself in that neglected corner completely unbeknownst to you. Free from the risk of pests or disease, keep on top of watering and the Goji Berry is happy to get on with the job - producing berries by the punnet load year-after-year. Shelter your plant from the worst of the winter in its first year either by bringing pots into a greenhouse or by covering with fleece outdoors. Sow: January-March. Harvest: July-October (year 2).  ¬†  ¬†",

With the culmination of years worth of work at Rutgers University in New York, they have managed to breed a basil that is downy mildew resistant. Strong downy mildew resistance allows this basil to be grown anywhere, from pots and windowsills to greenhouse borders and patios.  This is a huge step forward, as producing a Genovese type with a compact, but highly productive plant habit is hard to come by! On this variety, the leaves are large, cupped, and medium green and let off a sweet and spicy aroma. For home-cooking, Basil 'Devotion' is perfect for a summer salad, garnished in soups or infused into pasta and stir-fries. 45-50cm tall, 20-30cm wide.",

    "description": "A superb blend of¬† Cos, red-tinged Batavia and Oak-leaf lettuce varieties. Why buy salad leaves from the supermarket when you can grow them easily at home? And you can get up to 3 crops from the same sowing! Ideal for garden or containers. Ready to eat in just 3 weeks. Growing instructions given on packet.  SMALL SPACES made easy! Are you feeling left behind by the ‚Äúgrow-your-own‚Äù revolution because you live in a gardenless apartment or have a postage-stamp-sized patio? Don‚Äôt worry: Anyone with a sunny windowsill, patio, or balcony can cultivate home-grown vegetables. In fact, choosing plants that are nutritious, delicious, and attractive is the ultimate way to maximise limited space. We‚Äôve tried and tested these varieties suitable for small spaces and know they‚Äôll succeed, but that‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt other vegetable seeds that you could try!  Tom says: Quick and easy lettuces are many peoples first veggie crop. Try mixing red and green lettuce leaves to add a note of bitterness to salads, or try slicing up little gem lettuces and saut√©ing with peas and garlic for an alternative homegrown lunch.  ¬†",

Try mixing red and green lettuce leaves to add a note of bitterness to salads, or try slicing up little gem lettuces and saut√©ing with peas and garlic for an alternative homegrown lunch.  SMALL SPACES made easy! Are you feeling left behind by the ‚Äúgrow-your-own‚Äù revolution because you live in a gardenless apartment or have a postage-stamp-sized patio? Don‚Äôt worry: Anyone with a sunny windowsill, patio, or balcony can cultivate home-grown vegetables. In fact, choosing plants that are nutritious, delicious, and attractive is the ultimate way to maximise limited space. We‚Äôve tried and tested these varieties suitable for small spaces and know they‚Äôll succeed, but that‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt other vegetable seeds that you could try!  ¬†",

    "description": "A cross between Iceberg and a Cos lettuce, it has boat-shaped leaves and the taste of iceberg with a hint of Christmas green peas. Its crunchy texture is suited to salads. This lettuce holds its shape when heated making it possible to serve the cupped leaves filled with hot foods. They are also a good wrapping leaf.  Perfect for piling up with freshly dug new potatoes, French beans and cherry tomatoes as a warm salad as the leaves don&#39;t wilt when they are heated. Even do away with the plate altogether to save on washing up!  ¬†",

The Luffa is the perfect eco- friendly and sustainable home-grown pan scourer or bath sponge.  The Luffa is a genus of subtropical and tropical vines in the cucumber family and it can also be cooked and eaten like courgettes! Eat them when they are young and tender (up to 15cm). Luffa plants grow like cucumbers and need a greenhouse, thriving in full sun and well drained but moist soil. Reaching heights of 201-250cm (79-98&quot;) and spread 41-50cm (16-20&quot;).

    "description": "Onion (spring) Seeds - Lilia  Onion 'Lilia' is a dual-purpose Italian variety with a particularly pungent flavour to it. This crop can be harvested as either spring onions, salad onions or be left to become bulb onions for winter use and storing. So perhaps see what kind of onion you fancy at the time!  If you opt to grow this as a salad onion, it has will boast lovely, dark green leaves and a shiny, deep red inner core. However, when fully matured, it develops and grows into its more defined red and white inner rings.  When 'Lilia' is in the process of growing, if you decide to harvest your onions at each stage (spring/salad), you will in fact be allowing the plants to mature without the need for further thinning! This is certainly a winning onion that deserves a place in your veg garden!",

Use raw, roasted, baked, or saut√©ed to compliment fresh flavours to your salads and a great source of fibre to your homecooked dishes.

The seed can be sown late December-April, planted outside in May and harvested August-October. Height 30-40cm (12-16&quot;) Spread 11-20cm (4-8&quot;).  With 200 seeds per average packet, this vegetable seed is a must-have addition to your homegrown produce.

    "description": "Onion Seeds - Elista  With onion 'Elista', you don't need to worry about stressful preparations or cut fingers. This variety is easy to peel and super easy to prep in the kitchen. Torpedo (elliptical) onions like these have a different kind of shape to any other regular onion, and by being slimmer than most, this gives them the ability to be easier to peel and slice. This also means less waste and less chance of cutting your fingers like you can on traditionally shaped onions, and you get to enjoy almost every ounce of your crop!  'Elista' is the brown variety of onion and has a stronger flavour. It is great for multiple homemade dishes but is especially delicious in french onion soup! If you cook your own winter casseroles, why not add these to the mix.  Once ready, the bulbs can be¬†harvested in August and can last in storage until April/May the following year. You heard right, that‚Äôs 9-10 months it can last in storage!",

It grows flavoursome, chunky, gradually tapering roots that measure up to a whopping 28cm (11‚Äù) in length. However, if you prefer even larger roots, just leave them to grow on!  As it says in the name, this parsnip is a strong, sturdy and reliable warrior that is also known for its resistance to root canker and holds its healthy foliage with pride. If you like your parsnips sweet, a good tactic is to leave the roots in the ground to get ‚Äòkissed‚Äô by the frost. The roots will continue to keep well in the ground, and these crops taste amazing when served up with a Sunday roast or left in the slow cooker for winter warming soups.",

The best thing? It‚Äôs a weed that will thrive on any patch of dry, dusty ground. ¬†Unusually the acid level of the crops (provided by malic acid, the same stuff that makes green apples taste sour) does fluctuate wildly over the course of each day, making them up to 10 times more sour when picked first thing in the morning than late in the afternoon. So choose when you pick these according to how much tang you fancy. The plants will provide continuous harvests until they are cut down by the first frosts. Sow: April-August. Harvest: May-October.  ¬†",

The mooli, the exotic oriental sister of the normal radish, is not only easy to grow but is infinitely more fun in the kitchen. Baked, boiled, fried, shredded & transformed into some pretty fancy dim sum. They come into crop at the chilly end of autumn when little else exciting is rearing its head & unlike their ubiquitous European siblings, are rather tricky to find outside of Asian grocers. They even come in a bewildering array of colours, from pure white to acid green and even a version with a shocking pink heart. Make space for half a dozen of these and open up a whole range of new culinary experiences way beyond the scope of the sad supermarket types. Sow: July-September. Harvest: August-November.",

Each fruit has a small seed cavity meaning less waste and more flesh. Excellent keepers, perfect to harvest and keep you in fresh squash throughout the winter. Perfect to roast as they go sticky and sweet, delicious! Harvest August-October. Height 40-50cm (16-20).",

Making them great for small space gardening, they are also slow-growing and self-fertile.  Harvesting from August through to September, blueberry fruits can be used the same as regular blueberries for¬†jams, fresh juice, and pies. Usually darker than American blueberries, the Wild Blueberry is pink-purple inside, whereas American blueberries are usually light cream/green, however, they taste the same!  Forage for wild blueberries from your very own doorstep or windowsill with this must-have variety for any keen gardener.",

The only key difference between them is that popcorn requires a slightly longer growing season to allow its kernels to fully ripen, unlike sweetcorn which is harvested when its ears are still immature.

    "description": "Developed by James Wong - Vigorous, high yielding plants. Perfect in salsas, sauces and guacamoles. Very similar to its relative, the tomato, but even easier to grow. Harvest fruit at any size larger than a walnut, whilst still green. Tastes like: tomato & lime. Latin Name: Physalis philadelphica.  Sealed inside their own little paper envelopes, these round, green tomato-like fruit were once actually more popular than tomatoes themselves amongst the Aztecs of their native Mexico. They are freshingly fruity and taste weirdly like a cross between a lime and beefsteak tomato.  Far easier to grow and immeasurably more productive than a lowly tomato, there is no excuse why every fajita fan shouldn‚Äôt make space for a couple of these too! Sow: March-April. Harvest: August-October.  ¬†  ¬†",

(Bush variety - very easy to grow as trusses do not require support and fruits without side shoots being removed.)  Tom says: We trial hundreds of new varieties every year in order to make sure only the very best varieties make it into our catalogue. The difference in flavours is incredible ‚Äì from savoury cooking tomatoes to pure sweetness for snacking and every conceivable flavour combination in between, we have something for every taste bud and growing situation.  ¬†",

    "description": "Delightful apricot tree producing wonderful apricots but can be grown in a large container in any small space. Ripens in August. Supplied in a 4 litre pot at a height of approximately 70cm (27¬Ω&quot;). Rootstock - Montclaire.  Small trees adapted to grow in different container sizes. And if you want, you can also transplant them into the open ground. They are a selection of the most tasty varieties of the most popular fruit species. All are self-fertile. Trees are grafted onto the most innovative rootstock, which reduces the vigour of the plant, provides a controlled growth and improves the characteristics of the fruits! Eventual height 1.5-2m, depending on container size.  All trees need pruning in some way and trees are very adaptable. What makes our patio range special is that they are quite happy in a pot for their lives, and naturally have an eventual height that does not exceed 2m, but they are just as happy and productive at 75cm. That is down to rootstock and the clonal selection.  Please see our supplier‚Äôs comments about his trees - In this image (under the main image) is a Garden Sun Red apple tree which I have grown in the same pot for the last 5 years. As you can see it is my height and that‚Äôs the height I wish it to be.It would be equally happy at 75cms though. Just to the left of me in the image is a patio almond which is now 7 yrs. old and as you can see that is just 75cms high and covered in fruits. It‚Äôs the size I wanted it to be.",

    "description": "Unlike most blackcurrants, which are primarily raised for juice production, Ebony has been specially selected for garden planting. Take one look and it&#39;s easy to see why: the size of the fruit is amazing - up to twice the size of other blackcurrants. But it&#39;s the taste that really sets Ebony apart as the fruit is exceptionally sweet with technical measurements suggesting it&#39;s the sweetest ever! Superb in fruit salads and sweet summer puddings. Supplied as a healthy two year old plant.",

    "description": "This recently introduced peach appears to be strongly resistant to leaf curl disease. From a chance seedling found by a Miss Pride in woods in Washington State, near Seattle. She noticed that it was peach leaf curl resistant and decided to propagate her own tree. When she moved she decided to take the tree with her but just before the move a large bear dug the tree up and totally wrecked it! Left with a pile of twigs she managed to revive and propagate a further tree and move it to a bear-free environment. Trees are self-fertile with pretty pink flowers and bear large, deliciously juicy fruits from early August. Pollination group 4. Grown on Montclaire rootstock which is highly productive with medium vigour. It also makes trees less susceptible to frost damage.  ¬†",

    "description": "Citrus Tree - Kumquat Grow these exotic ‚Äòchinese oranges‚Äô, a small citrus fruit! Kumquats, sometimes known as Chinese oranges, are the smallest of the common citrus fruits. Unusually, the skin and zest of a kumquat is sweet, while the juicy insides are tart with a hint of bitterness. A real winter treat, you can eat kumquats whole with no need to peel them. Why not try cooking them with sugar and spices for delicious comp√¥tes and aromatic chutneys? Or make your own kumquat liqueur? These plants are self-fertile and one of the most reliable citrus plants for fruiting with heavy crops of bright orange fruit with a superb flavour. Supplied in a 2.5 litre pot. Citrus trees are surprisingly hardy, tolerating low temperatures and will thrive in most gardens given a warm sunny position. In the UK they are perhaps best grown in a large pot or other suitable containers as this will make it easier for them to be moved as conditions determine. Citrus Trees will not tolerate wetter conditions and waterlogging for any length of time will usually result in the loss of a plant. For this reason, they should be grown in very free-draining soil or compost. Fruiting and Pruning Citrus plants are very rewarding to look after, providing endless interest as the small scented white flowers appear in spring, followed by small fruit as the flowers fade. With the correct conditions the fruit will grow steadily over the next six months until they ripen. The fruits can be picked off or left on the tree for ornamental purposes. To encourage a bushy plant and to maintain a good shape, plants can be trimmed just as the new growth starts to sprout in the spring.

Because these plants continue to crop all summer, you‚Äôll enjoy a steady stream of delicious strawberries right up until September.  The more fruits you pick, the more your plant will produce, so your dessert dishes will be brimming with fruit for the whole summer and into autumn. Oh happy days. Day-neutral strawberries are insensitive to day length. So they continuously grow fruit as long as the weather is fair.  These plants are easy to grow, and every berry has a wonderfully sweet burst of flavour. These strawberry plants don‚Äôt just deliver on the fruit front though, they also produce beautiful dark pink, white and pale pink flowers, so they‚Äôll create an ornamental talking point on your patio all summer.  They‚Äôre perfect for containers too, so they‚Äôre a great choice if you have a smaller outside space yet still want to grow your own fruit.  Your day-neutral plants will establish quickly this summer to produce a steady stream of strawberries throughout the growing season next year, and a lighter crop of fruits this year.  Our collection includes a mix of 3 varieties: F1 Delizz, F1 Toscana and F1 Frisan.",

The best part though, is the wonderful sweet strawberry burst of flavour from every handpicked berry.  These strawberry plants have a nice uniform and compact size making them perfect for containers, hanging baskets or garden alike. The hardest part of Strawberry Delizz¬Æ F1 won&#39;t be the growing -¬†but having some strawberries left for anyone else to enjoy!  Unlike most other strawberries these are day neutral, meaning they will crop throughout the summer. This means you&#39;ll have sweet, juicy fruit for months on end rather than just in June.

    "description": "The Mulberry Bush - Hard to find the fruits in supermarkets, you can have all the joys of growing your own mulberries without the hassle of keeping a large tree. With heights reaching 8 metres, many people don&#39;t have the space for a mulberry tree.  This dwarf, compact variety only reaches a height of approximately 1.5m (compared to normal mulberries that can reach up to 8m in height), making it suitable for any garden. It‚Äôs self-pollinating, fully hardy and fruits on both old and new wood, meaning you can be picking mulberries within the first year as opposed to the usual 8 or 9 years it takes most other mulberries.  And unlike other varieties that only produce fruit over a 3-week period towards the end of summer, Charlotte Russe (Matsunaga PBR) produces berries over a very long period, from May right through until September!  This self-pollinating variety is fully hardy and fruits on both old and new wood, meaning you can be picking mulberries within the first year as opposed to the usual 8 or 9 years it takes most other mulberry trees. Fruiting over a long period, berries will appear from May until September and have the added bonus of not containing pips. Ideal for beds and borders, patio pots and containers. Attractive to butterflies, bees and birds. Prefers full sun.  (Please note: Decorative pot not included.)  ¬†  How do I grow a Mulberry bush?  This Mulberry is perfect for growing in a pot. Plant into a decent size pot (approximately 20 litres) using multi-purpose compost and ideally mixing in a long term feed or feed regularly during the growing season with a shrub and fruit feed.",

The thorny stems produce a rapid, vigorous, good crop with excellent flavour that can be picked over a very long season from early July onwards. Berries have a gelatinous bite to compliment their fragrance. Delicious in desserts, jams and preserves, and excellent for freezing. &#39;Karaka Black&#39; plants are quick to establish and easy to grow, with excellent resistance to downy mildew. Supplied in a 2 litre pot.",

Comprises 3 crowns (1 of each variety):  Timperley Early¬†- One of the earliest to crop, delicious tasting and high yields with thick stems of red changing to green with red markings. Polish Raspberry - Quite possibly the best-tasting rhubarb we have ever trialled! Produces good crops of strong green stems that are washed with red, and taste divine. Victoria - A reliably heavy cropper. An easy-to-grow old favourite. Ideal for beginners as it requires so little attention!

    "description": "We‚Äôre very excited to offer a collection of fantastic day-neutral strawberry plants. Because these plants continue to crop all summer, you‚Äôll enjoy a steady stream of delicious strawberries right up until September.  The more fruits you pick, the more your plant will produce, so your dessert dishes will be brimming with fruit for the whole summer and into autumn. Oh happy days. Day-neutral strawberries are insensitive to day length. So they continuously grow fruit as long as the weather is fair.  These plants are easy to grow, and every berry has a wonderfully sweet burst of flavour. These strawberry plants don‚Äôt just deliver on the fruit front though, they also produce beautiful dark pink, white and pale pink flowers, so they‚Äôll create an ornamental talking point on your patio all summer.  They‚Äôre perfect for containers too, so they‚Äôre a great choice if you have a smaller outside space yet still want to grow your own fruit.  Your day-neutral plants will establish quickly this summer to produce a steady stream of strawberries throughout the growing season next year, and a lighter crop of fruits this year.  Our collection includes a mix of 3 varieties: F1 Delizz, F1 Toscana and F1 Frisan.",

    "description": "Saskatoon Berry (Amelanchier) Plant The Saskatoon Berry has been coined ‚Äòthe new blueberry‚Äô. With a similar appearance and tasting like a sweet fragrant blueberry. The fruit is studded with beautiful seeds with a taste reminiscent of marzipan. These two flavours together give the saskatoon berry its unique and delicious flavour.¬† The saskatoon berry is otherwise known as Amelanchier can have a flavour similar to blueberries and cherries with a slight hint of almond. The fruit of the Saskatoon berry is rich in anthocyanin which makes it perfect for jams, smoothies and making delicious desserts.¬† The Saskatoon plant originates from Canada. Amelanchier canadensis is a fantastic looking shrub which will grow in sun or part shade, with an average size of 200-250cm. With pretty star shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring, this plant will look amazing in flower beds and flower borders! The juicy berries will be ready to harvest from early July onwards. This plant doesn't just perform during spring and summer but will offer glorious foliage through the autumn too!¬† The Saskatoon plant will be easier to grow than blueberries as it will grow in any type of soil. They are super cold hardy and resistant to all kinds of pests and diseases! What more is there to love about this plant? The exotic looking reddish-puprle berries are packed with vitamins and antioxidants, perfectly fine to eat fresh from the bush just as blueberries are.¬† The Saskatoon Berry Plant is supplied in a 4 litre pot.¬†Caring for your Saskatoon Berry Saskatoon berry plants prefer a well drained, fertile soil, in a sunny position which is sheltered from cold winds. The site should be well worked to a depth of 25cm (10‚Ä≥) incorporating plenty of organic material such as well rotted manure or garden compost. Care should be taken to pick out all roots of perennial weeds. Apply a base dressing of general fertiliser as per the manufacturers recommendation.",

    "description": "Calamondin Citrus Plant Ideal for growing citrus fruit indoors Bring a taste of the Med to your home, conservatory or summer patio with this beautiful citrus tree. Their shiny green leaves, beautifully scented white flowers and vibrant fruit will create a real talking point! The striking bitter orange fruit and fragrant flowers last for weeks and this tree will continue to fruit and flower on and off all year round. Use the fruits orange or green in drinks and cooking. Harvest July-early October. Height 150-200cm; spread 100-150cm. The striking bitter orange fruit and fragrant flowers last for weeks and this tree will continue to fruit and flower on and off all year round. Use the fruits orange or green in drinks and cooking. Calamondin is a cross between the Mandarin Orange and the Kumquat. It has a very even and rounded bush growth habit which along with its propensity to flower and fruit in huge quantities makes it one of the easiest and most rewarding citrus to grow in the UK. The small fruits have a very thin skin and it is advised to cut the fruits from the tree rather than to pull the fruits to avoid tearing. The skin is sweet whilst the flesh is very acid, making for a real zing when eaten whole which you can most certainly do. It is very high in vitamin C. Calamondin is self-fertile.Looking after your Calamondin Citrus Plant Citrus trees are surprisingly hardy, tolerating temperatures down to -5¬∞C and will thrive in most gardens given a warm sunny position. In the UK they are probably best grown in a large pot or other suitable container as this will allow them to be moved as conditions dictate. Citrus Trees will not however tolerate wet conditions and water-logging for any length of time will usually result in the loss of a plant. For this reason they should be grown in very free draining soil or compost.

In summer they‚Äôll appreciate our high nitrogen feed, and in winter our more balanced feed to help flowers and fruit. Simply dissolve in water and apply.

This attractive citrus tree will not only make great fruit but smell wonderful too! It can take up to a year for the fruits to ripen, but once you have a taste, every minute is worthwhile.¬† You can harvest our oranges when ripe and once picked, they can keep for up to two weeks.¬† Orange trees are capable of surviving brief periods below 0C, but for the best result, are grow in large containers and move indoors to a bright frost free position from autumn to spring. A pollination companion will not be required for this tree, as it is self fertile.¬†Propagated onto 'PS' rootstock and supplied as a large specimen bush (often in fruit) in a 5 litre pot. Height: 2m (6'). Spread: 1.2m (2'). ¬†",

If planted outdoors, the spread will be about 1.5 metres so will appreciate some trimming to encourage it. Fruit weight average 1kg.",

This is a versatile heritage variety that can be enjoyed when eaten fresh, cooked, juiced or used for homemade cider. The dull, russet-skinned fruits might look less appealing than other modern varieties, with a few lumps and bumps, but rest assured the pale flesh has a delicious pear-drop flavour. It is fair to say this is as delicious as an apple can grow and really stands out in taste tests. Fruits can be harvested in early October and store well until February.  M26 Rootstock - Dwarf reaching a mature height of 2.5-3m (8-10')  Apple 'Ashmead's Kernel' is not self-fertile. For the heaviest crops, it is best grown with another variety. If you only have room for one tree then make sure that a neighbour has a tree close by that can act as a suitable pollinator.  Estimated time to cropping once planted: 2 years.Estimated time to best yields: 5 years.  Some parts of these flowers are edible.",

This is a versatile heritage variety that can be enjoyed when eaten fresh, cooked, juiced or used for homemade cider. The dull, russet-skinned fruits might look less appealing than other modern varieties, with a few lumps and bumps, but rest assured the pale flesh has a delicious pear-drop flavour. It is fair to say this is as delicious as an apple can grow and really stands out in taste tests. Fruits can be harvested in early October and store well until February.  M26 Rootstock - Dwarf reaching a mature height of 2.5-3m (8-10')  Apple 'Ashmead's Kernel' is not self-fertile. For the heaviest crops, it is best grown with another variety. If you only have room for one tree then make sure that a neighbour has a tree close by that can act as a suitable pollinator.  Estimated time to cropping once planted: 2 years.Estimated time to best yields: 5 years.  Some parts of these flowers are edible.",

    "description": "Remarkably easy to grow - just like tomatoes. You may well have seen this South American delicacy garnishing expensive dishes in posh restaurants, or in small, very pricey packets in supermarkets. If so you would be forgiven for thinking this glamorous fruit is far too high maintenance to grow on UK soil. Origin: South America. Latin name: Physalis peruviana.  Delicious and ornamental. Individual berries wrapped in a Chinese lantern. The Incan delicacy that thrives on neglect, giving fresh berries right up until Christmas. Tastes like: Gooseberries, kiwi, pineapple, orange.  Recognisable in patisseries or indeed many cocktails, these shiny golden berries, each wrapped in its own paper Chinese lantern, are one of the trendiest garnishes around. Also known as the Cape Gooseberry (although it originates from highland Peru), the golden berry, or simply by its genus name ‚ÄòPhysalis‚Äô, these sticky amber balls have a rich flavour of ripe gooseberries with a hint of tropical fruit, followed by a pleasant bitter sweet aftertaste. Sow: February-April. Harvest: August-October.  ¬†  ¬†",

Height 80-90cm (32-36&quot;). HP - Hardy perennial. This plant can have some beneficial impacts on feline welfare. However, not all cats will respond in this way to catmint, some may become agressive. Cats should be supervised when offered catnip/catmint.  ¬†",

If you?re already a fan of marigolds then you?re going to love this one?larger flowers (up to 3? across) and heights of nearly 3? sets the Marigold Mission Giant apart from other varieties. We?re thrilled to introduce the Marigold Mission Giant, complete with huge, beautiful heads and tight flowers.  Much bigger than other marigolds, this variety flowers 3? across, giving it a bushy appearance. Unlike other marigold varieties, these stunning blooms are resistant to poor weather too. The rock-hard acid green eye is so tightly compacted that the water sits on the top rather than soaking into the flower and rotting it.   Bright lemon yellow chrysanthemum-like flowers with stunning large 3 double blooms. Flowers start with a bright green eye and then 'puff' out into a full flower.Great for the back of a border or indoors as a cut flower - best with staking.",

With a name like &#39;Giraffe&#39; we expected these to be tall, but weren&#39;t prepared for just how tall! Initially they were level with the other giants, but then put on a spurt and climbed another metre to tower over their competitors. Each of the huge plants carried a single dinner-plate-sized flower that lasted for a few weeks but seemed a bit inconspicuous when they were so far away.

    "description": "Sanvitalia Seeds - The Hanging Basket Sunflower  Would you like to grow your own sunflowers but outdoor space is limited? Then our Sanvitalia seeds are perfect for you! With this variety, you can grow mini sunflowers in hanging baskets and containers, that boasts classic sunshine yellow flowers with a dark brown centre. These cascading plants are perfect to tumble from baskets and pots, growing an abundance of attractive little ‚Äòsunflower‚Äô like blooms around 2cm wide per flower head.  Sanvitalia produces well-branched plants that can extend up to 15-25cm high, cascading around 60cm and are sturdy and robust. It is unlikely for these to be damaged by winds and rain, so it is great for UK gardens. However, as we all know, sunflowers prefer the sunniest place you can grow them and they are annual plants, so they will come into bloom from June to the first frosts (usually October). For a longer flower period, make sure to regularly deadhead your plants so you can enjoy the sunshine sunflowers for longer!",

Spring is the time that most people think of sowing their sweet peas (Lathyrus odoratus) without realising that traditionally, they used to be sown in the autumn for early summer flowering the following year. They will flower from late May onwards. The benefit of autumn sowing, apart from earlier flowering, is in the fact that larger, more robust plants are produced, resulting in better flowering performance. They are quite hardy, and will grow through the winter with a minimum of protection. Try Suttons ‚Äòtried and tested‚Äô selection - you won‚Äôt be disappointed!",

Yet give it a chance in your veg patch and it will adorn your beds with an almost inexhaustible supply of peppery leaves, watercress-flavoured flowers and crisp seed pods for literally months on end.  ¬†  ¬†",

    "description": "Brighten up your flower beds & containers with these stunning flowers! The Calendula Pot Marigold is a perennial that prefers warmer climates. Despite typically being a short lived perennial, the Calendula Pot Marigold is usually grown as an annual in flower beds and flower borders or decorative containers. Originating from the same family as marigolds, chrysthanthemums and daisies, the Calendula Pot Marigold has that iconic daisy =-like aesthetic but with stunning bright orange colours. Loved by bees, butterflies and other pollinating insects, it‚Äôs worth knowing that the Calendula Pot Marigold has been produced without the use of synthetic fertilisers or pesticides. These organically certified seeds have been raised in a way that is much better for our soil and the environment. The flowers of the Calendula Pot Marigold can be used to add colouring to rice or in salads. Flowering from June to July and growing to a height of 45cm (18‚Äù). And why not try the flowers in a salad? - pick them young for the best taste!",

A little less spiky than a true cactus dahlia, each petal starts broad at the base, tapering to a refined point, creating full blooms that are beautiful in a garden setting and even better enjoyed as a cut flower. These dahlia plants produce eye catching white and purple-pink bicolour blooms over a very long flowering season - perfect for adding autumn colour to the garden. The tubers can be lifted after the first hard frost of autumn and replanted the following spring for bigger, better displays each and every year. Height: 1.2m (4'). Spread 90cm (3') Culinary note: All dahlia flowers and tubers are edible. The flavours and textures can vary greatly depending on the soil and conditions in which they were grown. Flavours range from water chestnut through to a spicy apple or even carrot. For more details about edible flowers",

Daffodils look great when planted with perennials, annuals and other flowering shrubs too, but the Sagana grows with a unique difference to the standard daffodil. It might have the looks of more common varieties like 'Pheasants Eye', but this flower grows with much stronger and larger blooms that stand upright and really form a show-stopping display in garden borders and patio pots!  As white as can be petals smother the button like trumpet of vibrant yellow, with a fiery orange rim. A musky fragrance diffuses from the blooms which work perfectly for cut flower arrangements so this bulb really can be enjoyed indoors and out! Sagana is a strong, long-lived bulb that will thrive in sunny, well-drained places and will develop these magnificent flowers in multiples with minimal maintenance. Height: 40cm (16). Spread: 30cm (12).",

    "description": "Rare and highly sought after, this is the first and original black hyacinth! Available again due to popular demand - you won&#39;t find this variety for sale anywhere else! Launched to a frenzy of interest at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2005, Hyacinth &#39;Midnight Mystic&#39;¬Æ was soon completely sold out. A real breakthrough in breeding, 16 years was spent on developing just three mother bulbs and the result is this stunning, unusual hardy black hyacinth with a heavenly scent. Try it in contemporary silver patio pots, or grow it in beds and borders. Either way, make sure it&#39;s on show for all to enjoy! (Please note: Bulbs may cause irritation.)",

    "description": "Tulip 'Blueberry Ripples' boasts rich, purple long-lasting blooms that are nicely fragrant. This modern and stylish variety is rather exquisite as the sturdy stems are topped with striking white petals, each licked with bold purple-blue flames. For best results, grow these tulips in dense groups where you can enjoy their striking colours and distinctive blooms at maximum impact. Perfect for cutting for indoor flower arrangements and will even last for up to 10 days in a vase. Height: 45cm (18). Spread: 20cm (8).  Culinary Tips: Some parts of these flowers are edible. However, some people have had strong allergic reactions to Tulip flowers. If touching them causes a rash, numbness etc. then Tulip flowers should not be eaten.¬†",

Creating more than just a pretty picture, these tulips are truly delightful grown in decorative patio containers, making more than just a masterpiece.  Although the Tulip Bulbs - Rembrandt Mix are named after famous and renowned artist Rembrandt, he very rarely painted tulips or any flowers for that matter. These Tulips are named because they are decorated by magnificent petals with a painterly strokes of red or yellow as if they had been pulled straight from a painting!  Rembrandt famously immortalised these Tulips in his painting of his wife called ‚ÄòFlora‚Äô in which she wears a wreath of flowers. The largest flower of them all is the gorgeous Rembrandt Tulip. Rembrandt lived and worked in Holland around the time that tulips first became all the rage there, particularly the ones with streaks and stripes of colour. These types of tulips were bought for huge sums of money during the so-called ‚ÄòTulipmania‚Äô period (1593‚Äì1637), making the Tulips a perfect addition to his painting.  The Tulip Bulbs - Rembrandt Mix includes 5 striking bicoloured Tulips that flower from March until May. Growing to a height of 45cm, these hardy perennials are absolutely perfect for creating beautiful masterpieces in your garden this season.",
