      "description": "DEVELOPED BY JAMES WONG - James is an enthusiastic Kew trained botanist, RHS award winner, author and TV presenter who is renowned for thinking outside of the box when it comes to exciting and unusual fruit and vegetable varieties to grow at home.  Already a firm favourite amongst James&#39; fans and gracing the dishes of many a TV chef, these tiny watermelons lookalikes have a refreshing flavour and bags of personality. Plus, their lush vines will produce masses of fruit throughout the summer with a ‚Äòcucumber and lime‚Äô taste, Ready when they are grape-sized and still firm to the touch. Try in salads, pickled whole, or why not explore their cocktail-enhancing prowess? Easy to grow. Vigorous climber/trailer. Pest and drought resistant. Origin: Mexico. Latin name: Melothria scabra.  These tiny watermelon look-a-likes from Central America are small enough to fit into a teaspoon, yet bite into one and the flavour is pure cucumber with a fresh tinge of lime. Popular since pre-Columbian times, these rampant trailing vines produce a constant stream of fruit throughout the summer, known in Mexico as ‚ÄòSand√≠itas de Raton‚Äô, literally ‚ÄúLittle Mouse Watermelons‚Äù. Despite their exotic origins and adorable appearance, they are much easier to grow than regular cucumbers. They are ignored by pests, resistant to drought & perfectly happy to grow outdoors in the UK, given a sheltered sunny site. Tastes like: Cucumber and lime.  Cucamelons can also be treated like a perennial providing you with fruit year-after-year. In late autumn once the fruiting period is over, lift the cucamelon&#39;s main radish like root and store in barely moist compost in a garage or shed over winter. Plant out again in early April to achieve early fruiting. Sow: April-May. Harvest: July-September.  For more information on growing cucamelon from seed, read our growing guide here  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†",

      "description": "Developed by James Wong - Believe it or not, these pretty little daisy flowers have a big surprise - they taste like citrus with a jolt of electricity! Their fizzy electric buzz effect is like nothing you will have tasted before. Similar to popping candy, cloves, or a 9 volt battery, this unusual sensation is perfect for spicing up your cooking, bringing an unexpected zing to a dessert or sorbet, or adding a mouth-tingling twist to a glamorous cocktail. Stunning as bedding plants in any garden. Snip flowers off when they reach full colour, but only try a few petals! The more you snip, the more flowers will come. Origin: Brazil. Latin name: Acmella oleracea. Tastes like: Citrus with a jolt of electricity!  Pop one of these unassuming little yellow flowers in your mouth and you will soon find out how it got its range of colourful common names; everything from ‚Äòbuzz buttons‚Äô to ‚Äòtoothache plant‚Äô. An initial burst of citrus tang is quickly followed by a curious, tingly sensation - like a jolt of electricity - that fills your whole mouth, ending in a mild local anaesthesia that can last for up to 15 minutes!  This fizzy ‚Äòspace dust‚Äô-like effect - which some have likened to licking a 9 volt battery - is produced by the plant‚Äôs high levels of a pain-relieving agent called spilanthol, explaining its traditional use in treating toothache, mouth ulcers & sore throats for centuries. Spilanthol&#39;s muscle relaxing effects have even meant that an extract of the plant has found its way into high-end face creams that claim to have a natural &#39;botox&#39; effect. Sow: March-April. Harvest: June-October.  ¬†  ¬†",

The eastern &#39;superfood&#39; that‚Äôs easier to grow than a stinging nettle. Tastes like: Malt, tomato, cranberry.¬†Origin: China. Latin name: Lycium barbarum.  The goji berry bush is a perennial plant and as such will continue to produce fruits each year. You might be surprised to learn that the exotic Himalayan Goji Berry lives a secret double life as a common, and quite often very invasive, weed throughout much of the UK. Highly productive, delicious and foolproof to grow, before planting one of these it is actually even worth double checking that it hasn‚Äôt already planted itself in that neglected corner completely unbeknownst to you. Free from the risk of pests or disease, keep on top of watering and the Goji Berry is happy to get on with the job - producing berries by the punnet load year-after-year. Shelter your plant from the worst of the winter in its first year either by bringing pots into a greenhouse or by covering with fleece outdoors. Sow: January-March. Harvest: July-October (year 2).  ¬†  ¬†",

With the culmination of years worth of work at Rutgers University in New York, they have managed to breed a basil that is downy mildew resistant. Strong downy mildew resistance allows this basil to be grown anywhere, from pots and windowsills to greenhouse borders and patios.  This is a huge step forward, as producing a Genovese type with a compact, but highly productive plant habit is hard to come by! On this variety, the leaves are large, cupped, and medium green and let off a sweet and spicy aroma. For home-cooking, Basil 'Devotion' is perfect for a summer salad, garnished in soups or infused into pasta and stir-fries. 45-50cm tall, 20-30cm wide.",

This kale will also provide the crispiness you need in homecooked dishes along with its superfood nutritional values.¬†  It is best used for multiple cuts, as picking leaves from the bottom upwards will prolong the harvesting period.

Luffas come from plants similar to a climbing courgette and not from the sea! Why just grow veg when you can grow other household staples too? The Luffa is the perfect eco- friendly and sustainable home-grown pan scourer or bath sponge.  The Luffa is a genus of subtropical and tropical vines in the cucumber family and it can also be cooked and eaten like courgettes! Eat them when they are young and tender (up to 15cm). Luffa plants grow like cucumbers and need a greenhouse, thriving in full sun and well drained but moist soil. Reaching heights of 201-250cm (79-98&quot;) and spread 41-50cm (16-20&quot;). Harvest late August-October.",

If you opt to grow this as a salad onion, it has will boast lovely, dark green leaves and a shiny, deep red inner core. However, when fully matured, it develops and grows into its more defined red and white inner rings.  When 'Lilia' is in the process of growing, if you decide to harvest your onions at each stage (spring/salad), you will in fact be allowing the plants to mature without the need for further thinning!

The seed can be sown late December-April, planted outside in May and harvested August-October. Height 30-40cm (12-16&quot;) Spread 11-20cm (4-8&quot;).

      "description": "Onion Seeds - Elista  With onion 'Elista', you don't need to worry about stressful preparations or cut fingers. This variety is easy to peel and super easy to prep in the kitchen. Torpedo (elliptical) onions like these have a different kind of shape to any other regular onion, and by being slimmer than most, this gives them the ability to be easier to peel and slice. This also means less waste and less chance of cutting your fingers like you can on traditionally shaped onions, and you get to enjoy almost every ounce of your crop!  'Elista' is the brown variety of onion and has a stronger flavour. It is great for multiple homemade dishes but is especially delicious in french onion soup! If you cook your own winter casseroles, why not add these to the mix.  Once ready, the bulbs can be¬†harvested in August and can last in storage until April/May the following year. You heard right, that‚Äôs 9-10 months it can last in storage!",

It grows flavoursome, chunky, gradually tapering roots that measure up to a whopping 28cm (11‚Äù) in length. However, if you prefer even larger roots, just leave them to grow on!  As it says in the name, this parsnip is a strong, sturdy and reliable warrior that is also known for its resistance to root canker and holds its healthy foliage with pride. If you like your parsnips sweet, a good tactic is to leave the roots in the ground to get ‚Äòkissed‚Äô by the frost. The roots will continue to keep well in the ground, and these crops taste amazing when served up with a Sunday roast or left in the slow cooker for winter warming soups.",

The best thing? It‚Äôs a weed that will thrive on any patch of dry, dusty ground. ¬†Unusually the acid level of the crops (provided by malic acid, the same stuff that makes green apples taste sour) does fluctuate wildly over the course of each day, making them up to 10 times more sour when picked first thing in the morning than late in the afternoon. So choose when you pick these according to how much tang you fancy. The plants will provide continuous harvests until they are cut down by the first frosts. Sow: April-August. Harvest: May-October.  ¬†",

The mooli, the exotic oriental sister of the normal radish, is not only easy to grow but is infinitely more fun in the kitchen. Baked, boiled, fried, shredded & transformed into some pretty fancy dim sum. They come into crop at the chilly end of autumn when little else exciting is rearing its head & unlike their ubiquitous European siblings, are rather tricky to find outside of Asian grocers. They even come in a bewildering array of colours, from pure white to acid green and even a version with a shocking pink heart. Make space for half a dozen of these and open up a whole range of new culinary experiences way beyond the scope of the sad supermarket types. Sow: July-September. Harvest: August-November.",

As tasty as it is ornamental, Popcorn Fiesta is the one sure-fire way to get kids to eat their veg.Particularly when they get to see the whole ear somersaulting in the microwave, spitting out little white clouds of deliciousness!  Growing popcorn is just as easy as regular sweetcorn and can essentially be treated in the exact same way. The only key difference between them is that popcorn requires a slightly longer growing season to allow its kernels to fully ripen, unlike sweetcorn which is harvested when its ears are still immature. Origin: South America - Latin name: Zea mays. Sow: April-May. Harvest: August-November.  ¬†  ¬†",

Harvest fruit at any size larger than a walnut, whilst still green. Tastes like: tomato & lime. Latin Name: Physalis philadelphica.  Sealed inside their own little paper envelopes, these round, green tomato-like fruit were once actually more popular than tomatoes themselves amongst the Aztecs of their native Mexico. They are freshingly fruity and taste weirdly like a cross between a lime and beefsteak tomato.  Far easier to grow and immeasurably more productive than a lowly tomato, there is no excuse why every fajita fan shouldn‚Äôt make space for a couple of these too! Sow: March-April. Harvest: August-October.  ¬†  ¬†",

      "description": "Bean (Runner) Seeds - Black Knight  The story is that this runner bean has been grown by the Bishop of Shrewsbury, Edmund Knight, and to have been passed to some of the local congregants in the late 1800‚Äôs. This could be true or an old wife‚Äôs tale, but where it originates from has been certainly been lost in time and history. The beans of 'Black Knight' may look a little more gnarly than most, but they are still tender and juicy even when the pods become older and the beans begin to show. For the best tasting results, steam lightly to keep their colour. Pods range from 20-30cm.",

      "description": "Pumpkin (Organic) Seeds - Jack Be Little  Fantastic miniature squash & pumpkins that taste as good as they look!  The Squash & Pumpkin Jack Be Little is a very interesting and fun to grow variety. These colourful little pumpkins grow to just 8cm in diameter when fully grown! This means they are great for adding to meals but also to make amazing Halloween decorations! These pumpkins taste absolutely delicious when they are stuffed and baked, and being only 8cm across, they make ideal serving portions.¬†  Great for creating mini Halloween decorations too! Once the inside has been consumed, you can use the outer shell as a pumpkin soup bowl or a spooky decoration that you‚Äôve grown yourself! The skin of this variety can also be eaten. Simply boil it for 5 minutes before baking and enjoy!",

It&#39;s early too, giving the first succulent tasty spears in mid to late April and continuing to crop heavily until mid-June. It is an &#39;all-male&#39; hybrid, forming no seeds which means all its energies go into spear production.

Plant by setting bulbs 15cm (6) apart in rows 30cm (12) apart with the small bulbs tips showing above the soil surface. 250g of sets (approximately 60 sets) will plant a row of approximately 6m (19').",

They're deliciously sweet picked fully ripe like a normal tomato, but fruit will start to 'dry' on the plant without splitting or dropping, this means they get even sweeter and have the texture of Italian antipasti tomatoes.
