      "description": "The GMD1000M submersible pressure-switch operated water pump is the solution for a working system. Standard pumps basically transfer from A to B, this pump has the features detailed below, allowing the operator to work with the water away from the pump and when stopping the pump is necessary the pump will sense when demand for water has stopped and will then shut down.    On sensing a drop in the water pressure in the discharge line the pump will start automatically thus eliminating the need for the operator to walk back the pump / starter to start and stop the pump. In addition there is also automatic control of the pump in low water level conditions, ensuring the pump does not run dry. The pump runs off a single phase supply.    Submersible pumps with built-in integrated electronics designed to automatically start and stop the pump and prevent against dry running.¬†        Can be used as a water butts pump or with a rainwater tanks.

      "description": "Slash your water bill with this 3P Technik Garden Steelpump which is a heavy duty and industrial standard water pump designed for domestic applications.  You'll be able to enjoy the pressure and convenience of mains water while using free rainwater with this reliable pump, which comes with a two-year guarantee and an NRV (non-return valve) as standard.  Simply connect a hose or tap to the pump and it will run when you open the tap and automatically shut off when you close it, so there is no need to run and switch the pump off. The pump can supply water at 4 bar of pressure allowing it to push water uphill as high as 40 metres. Using the pump, the flow rate through a 1/2 inch hosepipe is similar to mains water.  Please note: This pump is only suitable for filtered water so only use with good quality rainwater tanks which have had the water pre-filtered on entry, for example by using a filter-collector such as the one sold with our rank tank systems.  Pump technical details:    Power rating: 600W  Weight: 15kg  Maximum flow rate: 3,000 litres/ hour  Supply voltage: 230/240V  Water resistance: IP68 (it is submersible)  Power cable: 10 metres in length  Inlet: 1\" Female BSP Outlet: 1.25\" Female BSP    Dimensions:    Length: 477mm  Width: 200mm  Height: 226mm    ¬†",

      "description": "This Portable 230v Self-Priming Water Butt Pump is an ideal pump to use if your tank has limited access and installing a submersible pump is not a practical solution.        This green and black pump can work at 4 bar pressure and will be good for watering the garden and also the light pressure washing jobs.        The pump can be installed on top of the tank and if you install the suction strainer just off the bottom of the tank the pump will draw clean water without any of the silt from the bottom of the tank.        It¬¢‚Äö¬¨‚Äû¬¢s also a portable, single stage and self-priming jet pump with a thermoplastic body, venturi and impeller.        The stainless steel shaft is fitted with a carbon ceramic and NBR mechanical seal, the IP44 motor has water resistant rocker switch and overload protection and it¬¢‚Äö¬¨‚Äû¬¢s designed for pumping clean water only, at a maximum temperature of 35‚Äö¬∫C.        It should not be allowed to run dry, but by fitting an optional pressure controller it can be protected from this and also start and stop automatically. Maximum recommended suction lift, when primed, is 8 metres.        If you are performing a suction lift we recommend that a foot-valve and strainer should be fitted to the end of the suction hose. This is included with our 4 metre suction kit. These are available as an optional extra and include a pump coupling, which is factory fitted to the hose for a vital, airtight connection.        Fitted as standard with a carrying handle and a 2 metre rubber power lead. This pump is ideal for transfer and irrigation duties in domestic and light industrial applications.

      "description": "Tiger worms are the best worms you can use in your wormery for worm composting. Supplied in breathable pouches and sent by secure delivery service to arrive in a healthy condition. Due to our storage methods, worms may arrive in a dormant state. They are still happy and healthy but may need a few days to wake up. Our Tiger worms are sent in pouches weighing 250 grams per pack with soil in the pack for their comfort.  PLEASE NOTE: Pouches are produced by weight. The number of worms per pouch is dependent on the size of worms. If you are redeeming a Worm Card Voucher, click HERE to redeem your voucher by adding it to your basket and then proceeding to checkout.  So why are Tiger worms best for a Wormery? There are three native species of worm which are all good at the rapid processing of dead organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. These are:    The Tiger worm, aka the Brandling worm. Proper name Eisenia fetida.¬†  The Bluenose worm, aka Dendobaena and the European nightcrawler and by some as Eisenia hortensis. Proper name Dendrobaena veneta.  The Redworm, aka the red wiggler and the Brandling worm. Scientific name:¬†Eisenia Andrei.    All are good and will work well in your wormery. But, for adaptability, conditions tolerance, versatility, and composting rate the answer is the Tiger worm.  Some Worm facts:    Tiger worms are a little more expensive and significantly better than Dendrobaena in Wormeries.  Young worms are preferable (hungrier) to older worms.  When it comes to composting - the condition, age, size and species of worm is more important than their weight.  Tiger worms reach sexual maturity (they are hermaphrodite) in approx 6 weeks.  Dendrobaena are more widely available than Tigers as there is an established 'cottage' industry breeding them for anglers who hook them up as bait. They are also easier to harvest and are usually cheaper.    View our new ‚ÄòBuilding Your Wormery Guide‚Äô which includes a step-by-step process for setting up your wormery.",

Due to our storage methods, worms may arrive in a dormant state. They are still happy and healthy but may need a few days to wake up.  Includes:    2 x 250g pouch of Tiger Worms  1 x 650g Coir Block Bedding  1 x 1.5kg Lime Mix  1 x 1.5kg Worm Treats  1 x Moisture Mat  1 x Tiger Wormery Tap  1 x Composting with Worms Book  1 x Handy Wormery Information Guide    Worm Treats: Made from 100% sustainably resourced and non contaminated wood waste, known as 'Ecowood' Our pelletised Worm Treats rapidly absorb excess moisture, swell up and are readily processed by your happy Tiger Worms.  Lime Mix: Keep your worms thriving with our environmentally friendly soft lime mix. This mix will ensure that the environment in the Wormery is stable and non-acidic. Simply add a handful every month, or more if you use lots of acidic fruits. Typically, one bag (1.5kg) should last you 6 months or more!  Worms: Tiger Worms are the best worms you can use in your wormery for worm composting. They're supplied in breathable pouches and sent by secure delivery already in soil to make sure they arrive in a healthy condition. Coir  Moisture Mat: The Coir Mat is to be placed on the surface of the food waste. Adding the coir moisture mat keeps your compost warm and moist and will make it easier for the worms to find the surface and encourage them upwards to where the food waste is. The mat will eventually degrade and be eaten up by the worms themselves, leaving behind a nutrient-dense vermicompost.  Composting with Worms Book: An interesting read from George Pilkington, a worm composting connoisseur with over 20 years experience.  Coir Block: Approx 650 grams in weight. Coconut Coir is extracted from the husk on the outer shell of a coconut, because of its superior water holding capacity, excellent air space and drainage, coir is a useful soil amendment for potted plants, containers, gardens and as wormery bedding. Just gradually add water until the coir is damp to the touch. It can also be added dry and broken up to soak up extra moisture in wormeries, to help you produce the best vermicompost you can.

      "description": "Our Wormeries work by harnessing the surface feeding nature of the hungry tiger worms contained within. This happens naturally as it's a trait of these composting worms to live near the surface rather than deep into the compost. However, by adding a moisture mat to your Wormery you make it easier for the worms to find the surface and encourage them upwards.    They can also help prevent occasional fly infestations by adding another barrier to the outside world. Simply pop a damp mat on the surface of the food waste in your Wormery and leave it there.When you add new food waste, add it just underneath the mat.    The mat, being made of Coir and being natural will eventually degrade and be eaten up itself by the worms, leaving behind a rich organic vermicompost.    Our Moisture Mats are available in the following sizes (cm) to fit each Wormery:        Junior Wormery (Round) - 25cm (w) x 1cm (d)    Midi Wormery (Round) - 29cm (w) x 1cm (d)    Indoor Womery (Stainless Steel) (Round) - 29cm (w) x 1cm(d)    Rainbow Wormery (Round) - 29cm (w) x 1cm (d)    Original Womery (Rectangular) - 34cm (w) x 40cm (h) x 1cm (d)    Tiger Womery (Square) - 36cm (w) x 1cm (d)",

Alternatively you can throw in a handful or two of this specially prepared wood-based pelletised 'treats' made from 100% sustainably resourced and non contaminated wood waste. Known as 'Ecowood', they rapidly absorb excess moisture, swell up and are then processed by your happy Tiger Worms.  In typical use, a 1.5kg bag should be plenty for one Wormery for about 6 months (although it won't do any harm if you use more). Whilst by no means essential, they are an entirely natural accelerator to worm composting and a handful added every 3 or 4 weeks will help ensure your Wormery stays sweet, well balanced and working at its best.  At this price for a 1.5kg bag they also represent great value.  ¬†  View our new ‚ÄòBuilding Your Wormery Guide‚Äô which includes a step-by-step process for setting up your wormery.",

      "description": "The Green Cone is a four-part injection moulded unit comprising a lower basket installed below ground and forming the base for an upper assembly consisting of a black inner cone and a green outer lidded plastic cone. The diameter of the outer Green Cone is 59cm at its base and 28cm at the lid end. The in-ground food waste digestion chamber is 42cm deep and the Green Cone stands less than 70cm above the ground. The Green Cone takes all household food waste, including vegetable scraps, raw and cooked meat or fish, bones, dairy products and other organic kitchen waste e.g. tea bags, bread etc. The Green Cone comes with a 5 litre kitchen caddy for collecting and carrying household food waste to the Green Cone. The patented design of the unit utilises a solar heating effect between the inner and outer cones to promote air circulation, which facilitates the growth of beneficial micro-organisms and the desirable aerobic digestion process. The household food waste is converted into water, carbon dioxide and small amount of residue that will only need to be removed every few years in a well operating Green Cone. In a healthy working Cone the food waste will be covered in a blue/grey fur, this is the bacteria doing it's work. While you can see the bacteria you do not need to add accelerator powder. When the level of bacteria starts to disappear add some accelerator powder. Your Green Cone is supplied with accelerator powder and an application jar. Where the Green Cone is situated in a position that does not enjoy a full days sunshine, or when there are long periods of cold weather, the digestion process may benefit from the application of this powder.  What can go in:    Fish  Red meat and poultry  All bones  Bread  Fruit (including peelings)  Vegetables (including peelings)  Dairy produce  Cooked food scraps  Crushed egg shells  Tea bags  Animal excrement    ¬†  What to avoid:    Metal  Wood  Plastic  Glass  Paper  Straw  Grass cuttings  Hedge clippings  Bulk oil  Disinfectant and bleaches  \"Special treatment items\"    ¬†     Dimensions: Total height of cone: 110cm Height above ground: 70cm Depth below ground: 42cm Lid diameter: 28cm Base diameter: 38cm Weight: 8.5kg Volume of basket: 80 litres",

Every year the same natural cycle occurs; leaves, twigs and trees fall to earth, decompose and become food for new plants. Naturally occurring micro-organisms, bugs and worms, together with oxygen and moisture do all the work.  In the process heat is produced. Some very valuable micro-organisms work at temperatures as high as 65C (150F)! This is '?hot'? composting, oxygen in the air is critical to the process.

      "description": "The Compost Duvet has been developed to prevent heat loss in the compost, especially useful in the early stages of decomposition. Heat builds up naturally and if it can be maintained it can destroy weeds, seeds and disease. This entirely new concept has proved to maintain high temperatures within the compost, both day and night. It will also keep out frosts in winter.  The Duvet fits snugly into our wooden bins but it can be used on any compost pile or in any compost bin. Can be ordered in 2 sizes: 400 fits 400, 800 and 1150 Blackdown Range Wooden Composters 600 fits 600, 1200 and 1900 Blackdown Range Wooden Composters The 400L compost duvet can also be used to warm up your wormery during the winter months.  The worms need temperatures of about 15-20¬∞C and during the winter months the temperatures can drop below O¬∞C, so in order for your worms to survive, a duvet such as this could be required to keep them warm and alive. Product image shows the Compost Duvets on a standard 400 Blackdown Range Single Wooden Composter which is not included.  Please note - all UK Redwood timber has been high pressure and vacuum treated with preservative which allows for a 15 year warranty on our composters and raised beds. Colour of wood may vary from images shown as a result of the treatment process.   Also note, you may receive your order and the timber may be wet, this can be because it has stood out in the rain during transit or it can be the timber has not dried out from the preservative treatment process.   If the composter is received with the timber wet you may also notice some mould on the timber this will disappear when the timber dries and will not affect the operation or the warranty we give. This will not affect the use of the composter or raised bed, however there may be some warping and twisting of the timber as the timber dries. When timber dries out there may also be some shrinkage, however this can be mainly mitigated by ensuring all the screws are used in the installation and they are firmly secured into the timber.",

      "description": "The Triple Slotted Wooden Composter is from our Blackdown Range and its 1900L capacity so it‚Äôs a great choice for composting in large volumes. You get a 15 year guarantee on this composter due to the wood treatment process we put it through. This traditional design can hold food and garden waste, and you can use each bin for a different stage of the composting process. While using the compost from one, you can let the other mature and fill remaining one. All material used to create this composter was sourced from UK forestry so it has a low carbon footprint compared to alternatives. The wood used is an FSC Certified and EUTR compliant redwood timber.  Please note - all wood used has been high pressure and vacuum treated with preservative which allows for a 15 year warranty on our composters and raised beds. Colour of wood may vary from images shown as a result of the treatment process.

Compost in style and show off your bokashi bin instead of hiding it in a cupboard. Suitable for all kitchens these Bokashi bins are sure to be a hit in the home as well as a great option for commercial kitchens. The lid has a rubber seal with 3 locks, its large capacity will enable it to hold lots more food waste.  Includes:  - 30 Litre Stainless Steel Bokashi Bucket- 2kg Bokashi Active Bran (approx 2 Months supply) - Stainless Steel Drainage Platform for Liquid drainage - PTFE Tape - 1/2\" Stainless Steel MF Ball Valve (or tap) (assembly required) -1/2\" Stainless Steel BSPP Hose Nipple - Bokashi Scoop - Full Instructions, Hints, Tips and Advice  Bokashi Buckets are clean, odourless and simple to use. You simply introduce your waste to the Bokashi Bucket, sprinkle some Bokashi Bran over the top and repeat the process until the Bokashi Bucket is full. Then, you leave it for 2-3 weeks to complete the fermentation, drawing liquid off every few days. Once complete, the waste is ready to be dug into the garden, added to your compost heap or introduced to a wormery to be 'finished off'. Because the Bokashi has fermented the food and neutralised any odour, it should no longer attract vermin when put into your composter.  Adding the fermented compost to the wormery will speed up the process in your wormery and it can help to produce nutrient rich liquid for composting. The anaerobic process it goes through in the Bokashi Bin and the aerobic process in the wormery, combines to make the most out of your food waste.

      "description": "The exclusive 30L Double Stainless Steel Bokashi Composter kit takes Bokashi composting to a whole new level. Compost in style and show off your bokashi bin instead of hiding it in a cupboard. Suitable for all kitchens these Bokashi bins are sure to be a hit in the home as well as a great option for commercial kitchens. The lid has a rubber seal with 3 locks, its large capacity will enable it to hold lots more food waste.  Includes:  - 2 x 30 Litre Stainless Steel Bokashi Bucket- 2kg Bokashi Active Bran (approx 2 Months supply) - Stainless Steel Drainage Platform for Liquid drainage - PTFE Tape- 1/2\" Stainless Steel MF Ball Valve (or tap) (some assembly required)- 1/2\" Stainless Steel BSPP Hose Nipple - Bokashi Scoop - Full Instructions, Hints, Tips and Advice  Bokashi Buckets are clean, odourless and simple to use. You simply introduce your waste to the Bokashi Bucket, sprinkle some Bokashi Bran over the top and repeat the process until the Bokashi Bucket is full. Then, you leave it for 2-3 weeks to complete the fermentation, drawing liquid off every few days. Once complete, the waste is ready to be dug into the garden, added to your compost heap or introduced to a wormery to be 'finished off' if you need it added to plants and vegetables. Because the Bokashi has fermented the food and neutralised any odour, it should no longer attract vermin when put into your composter.  Adding the fermented compost to the wormery will speed up the process in your wormery and it can help to produce nutrient rich liquid for composting. The anaerobic process it goes through in the Bokashi Bin and the aerobic process in the wormery, combines to make the most out of your food waste.

Also note, you may receive your order and the timber may be wet, this can be because it has stood out in the rain during transit or it can be the timber has not dried out from the preservative treatment process. If the composter is received with the timber wet you may also notice some mould on the timber this will disappear when the timber dries and will not affect the operation or the warranty we give. This will not affect the use of the composter or raised bed, however there may be some warping and twisting of the timber as the timber dries.

This will not affect the use of the composter or raised bed, however there may be some warping and twisting of the timber as the timber dries. When timber dries out there may also be some shrinkage, however this can be mainly mitigated by ensuring all the screws are used in the installation and they are firmly secured into the timber.  45cm High Extra Module for Raised Beds - Blackdown Range  Our 45cm high (3 plank) Extra Modules for Raised Beds can be bought in three different width sizes; 25cm, 50cm and 1m (100cm).

Please note - all UK Redwood timber has been high pressure and vacuum treated with preservative which allows for a 15 year warranty on our composters and raised beds. Colour of wood may vary from images shown as a result of the treatment process.   Also note, you may receive your order and the timber may be wet, this can be because it has stood out in the rain during transit or it can be the timber has not dried out from the preservative treatment process. If the composter is received with the timber wet you may also notice some mould on the timber this will disappear when the timber dries and will not affect the operation or the warranty we give. This will not affect the use of the composter or raised bed, however there may be some warping and twisting of the timber as the timber dries.

If the composter is received with the timber wet you may also notice some mould on the timber this will disappear when the timber dries and will not affect the operation or the warranty we give. This will not affect the use of the composter or raised bed, however there may be some warping and twisting of the timber as the timber dries. When timber dries out there may also be some shrinkage, however this can be mainly mitigated by ensuring all the screws are used in the installation and they are firmly secured into the timber.  75cm High Single Raised Beds - Blackdown Range  Our 75cm high (5 plank) Single Raised Beds can be bought in three different width sizes; 25cm, 50cm and 1m (100cm)  Ideal for all size gardens or allotments.Perfect for growing flowers, vegetables and herbs.Manageable sizes for beginner or experienced gardenersSimple and easy to assemble in minutesCan be used to separate spaces within the garden or create beautiful borders.Raised height to a nice working level.Can be extended with other Blackdown Range Raised Beds.All timber is FSC Certified.DimensionsHeight: 75cm / 750mm / 30 inchesLength: 100cm / 1000mm / 40 inchesWidth: 100cm  With our Blackdown Range Modular Raised Beds the options to extend length, height and width are endless;See our other Blackdown Range Raised Beds for other sizes and ideas.",

Colour of wood may vary from images shown as a result of the treatment process.   Also note, you may receive your order and the timber may be wet, this can be because it has stood out in the rain during transit or it can be the timber has not dried out from the preservative treatment process. If the composter is received with the timber wet you may also notice some mould on the timber this will disappear when the timber dries and will not affect the operation or the warranty we give. This will not affect the use of the composter or raised bed, however there may be some warping and twisting of the timber as the timber dries. When timber dries out there may also be some shrinkage, however this can be mainly mitigated by ensuring all the screws are used in the installation and they are firmly secured into the timber.  45cm High 3 Tiered Double Raised Beds - Blackdown Range  Our 3 Tiered Double Raised Beds can be bought in three different width sizes; 25cm, 50cm and 1m (100cm)  This 3 tiered raised bed can accommodate many varieties of plants, flowers or vegetables at once allowing you an unrestricted choice in planting or floral arrangements.

Colour of wood may vary from images shown as a result of the treatment process.   Also note, you may receive your order and the timber may be wet, this can be because it has stood out in the rain during transit or it can be the timber has not dried out from the preservative treatment process. If the composter is received with the timber wet you may also notice some mould on the timber this will disappear when the timber dries and will not affect the operation or the warranty we give. This will not affect the use of the composter or raised bed, however there may be some warping and twisting of the timber as the timber dries. When timber dries out there may also be some shrinkage, however this can be mainly mitigated by ensuring all the screws are used in the installation and they are firmly secured into the timber.  60cm High 3 Tiered Single Raised Beds - Blackdown Range  Our 3 Tiered Single Raised Beds can be bought in three different width sizes; 25cm, 50cm and 1m (100cm)  This 3 tiered raised bed can accommodate many varieties of plants, flowers or vegetables at once allowing you an unrestricted choice in planting or floral arrangements.

This will not affect the use of the composter or raised bed, however there may be some warping and twisting of the timber as the timber dries.

Please note - all UK Redwood timber has been high pressure and vacuum treated with preservative which allows for a 15 year warranty on our composters and raised beds. Colour of wood may vary from images shown as a result of the treatment process.   Also note, you may receive your order and the timber may be wet, this can be because it has stood out in the rain during transit or it can be the timber has not dried out from the preservative treatment process. If the composter is received with the timber wet you may also notice some mould on the timber this will disappear when the timber dries and will not affect the operation or the warranty we give. This will not affect the use of the composter or raised bed, however there may be some warping and twisting of the timber as the timber dries. When timber dries out there may also be some shrinkage, however this can be mainly mitigated by ensuring all the screws are used in the installation and they are firmly secured into the timber.  45cm High 5 Tiered Single Raised Beds - Blackdown Range  Our 5 Tiered Single Raised Beds can be bought in two different width sizes; 25cm and 50cm.

It is in fact an excellent rainwater harvesting system which includes a steel pump which is both waterproof and submersible. These black tanks are scalable and expandable, meaning that you can add at least one additional 800 litre tank to your rainwater harvesting system and you'll get good water pressure right around your garden. The tanks are simple to install and include a 3P Technik quality Filter Collector, ensuring maximum diversion of rainwater from your downpipes into your tank(s).

Launched at the GLEE Exhibition for the garden and leisure industry in September, Rainwater Terrace¬Æ was the star of the show, winning both the    Best in Garden Care and  The Retailers Choice awards.  The judges said enabling plants to feed from the water collection is a fantastic feature. The plants make it attractive to place outside your house, and it's a great price too.

The Rainwater Terrace¬†comes in both 200 and 134 litre sizes and in a range of colours including black, green/black and terracotta. It solves many of the issues associated with traditional water butts offering the householder the potential to save money by saving water whilst enjoying an attractive floral display or a mini herb garden.  The Rainwater Terrace¬†is a high quality product built to last.

      "description": "200L Rainwater Terrace Water Butt Planter - 3 Tier Rainwater Terrace¬Æ is a new multi award winning concept in rainwater collection promoting the reuse of valuable rainwater and ‚Äògrow your own‚Äô sustainability. It's unique patented modular design incorporates an integrated plant growing system enabling plants and herbs etc. to grow alongside the stored rainwater.  Launched at the GLEE Exhibition for the garden and leisure industry in September, Rainwater Terrace¬Æ was the star of the show, winning both the ‚ÄòBest in Garden Care‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Retailers Choice‚Äô awards. The judges said ‚ÄúEnabling plants to feed from the water collection is a fantastic feature. The plants make it attractive to place outside your house, and it‚Äôs a good price point too‚Äù. Rainwater Terrace¬Æ also recently became a Silver Winner in the DIY Week 2014 awards for the Garden Accessory of the Year and has just been shortlisted for Product of the Year at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show.  The Rainwater Terrace¬Æ comes in both 200 and 134 litre sizes and in a range of colours including black, green/black and terracotta. It solves many of the issues associated with traditional water butts offering the householder the potential to save money by saving water whilst enjoying an attractive floral display or a mini herb garden.  The Rainwater Terrace¬Æ is a high quality product built to last. Injection moulded in heavy gauge UV stable plastic; these strong durable components have excellent impact strength and are manufactured to perform in all weathers. Requiring no special tools or complicated plumbing it‚Äôs very simple and quick to install. Made in the UK.

Analysis of the efficiency of Fresha Tank conducted by Intertek.  Conclusion data from this study demonstrate that the viability of bacteria could be affected by different parameters such as a high stress, the porosity of the material, the natural desiccation of suspensions, the antimicrobial disposition at the surface, and the presence of surfactants.  All these parameters have to be controlled as seriously as possible to determine the real antimicrobial activity of each sample.  \"These results would show important decrease of all bacteria tested in contact with the product at 24hr time contact. To conclude, the inhibitory effects are an intrinsic property of the material.\"    **Only suitable for waterbutts with lids or avaliable access to place inside.**",

The product is supplied with the fixing screws and mounting bracket. There are 5 parts to the filter which are a slide fit into each other.

The user has the choice of using the Diverter outlet ( the smaller of the 2) or the main outlet to divert the rain water into a rainwater tub or rain water harvesting tank.  If the degree of filtration is inadequate for the use you are putting the rain water too, we have a Fine Mesh Insert available which fits into the filter basket and provides a far higher degree of filtration (800 micron). This will allow you to use the rainwater in your pressure washer and for washing the car.  If your guttering is attached to square downpipe, there is an adaptor in the box to allow the filter to be fitted to square drainpipes which are installed with close fitting brackets. If you have standard brackets you will not need the adaptor.  This rain water filter goes a long way to solving an age old problem associated with guttering and drainpipe systems on buildings. The biggest problem with guttering is it gets filled with leaves, stones, sand and moss. The result can be blockages or over flowing gutters.  This in turn can lead to damp penetrating the wall of your building or damp getting to the roof joists. Gutter blockage and overflow can lead to extremely expensive repairs to your property. The other problem associated with blocked guttering and drainpipes is the inherent danger of inspecting and cleaning them. Use of ladders should be avoided at all times if there is an alternative, namely the Gutter Mate Filter.  Downpipe (Drainpipe) Sizes  The GutterMate is designed to accept 68mm, 76mm and 80mm diameter and 65mm and 75mm square downpipes, without any adaptors or reducers, other than the square to round adaptor supplied with the filter, if needed as per the instructions. This adaptor is used if your square downpipe is fitted using ‚Ç¨≈ìclose fitting mounting brackets‚Ç¨¬ù to your house.  If the downpipe is fitted with ‚Ç¨≈ìstandoff mounting brackets‚Ç¨¬ù, the square to round adaptor is not needed. If the downpipe is larger than 80mm you will need a male to female reducer to get into the top of the filter. The GutterMate filter should not be used on downpipes larger than 100mm diameter and if using this diameter of downpipe consideration should be given as to the total roof area the filter is rainwater collecting from. The GutterMate rain water collecting filter can be used in the following applications.  Two common sizes of downpipe for Greenhouses, sheds and garages are 50 and 40mm diameter downpipes.In addition there are some metal downpipe sizes where the internal diameter of the pipe is too small to accept the main outlet of the Gutter Mate.  The filter can be used on these downpipes, when using these sizes a male female reducer will be needed for connection to the main outlet of the filter.

Watch our step-by-step guide on how to set up your Guttermate diverter & filter    ¬†  Watch our fitting instructions for our Fine Mesh Insert    Additional Technical Information  What's in the Box?  Each box contains:    Gutter Mate Filter Square to round adaptor for Square Downpipes  Blanking Cap for Diverter outlet, if needed  Hose Adaptor for Water Butt Screws and plugs for fitting Gutter mate to wall.  500mm of hose to connect Gutter Mate to water butt or tank. Subject to distance between Gutter mate and water butt / tank a longer length of hose may be needed. Which is available on this link GutterMate hose    The GutterMate rainwater diverter and filter is made from Polypropylene and is available in Black, White or Brown, to suit the colour of your drainpipe.  The product is supplied with the fixing screws and mounting bracket. There are 5 parts to the filter which are a slide fit into each other. The filter basket filters all the rainwater which falls down the downpipe.  The user has the choice of using the Diverter outlet ( the smaller of the 2) or the main outlet to divert the rain water into a rainwater tub or rain water harvesting tank.  If the degree of filtration is inadequate for the use you are putting the rain water too, we have a Fine Mesh Insert available which fits into the filter basket and provides a far higher degree of filtration (800 micron). This will allow you to use the rainwater in your pressure washer and for washing the car.  If your guttering is attached to square downpipe, there is an adaptor in the box to allow the filter to be fitted to square drainpipes which are installed with close fitting brackets. If you have standard brackets you will not need the adaptor.  This rain water filter goes a long way to solving an age old problem associated with guttering and drainpipe systems on buildings. The biggest problem with guttering is it gets filled with leaves, stones, sand and moss. The result can be blockages or over flowing gutters.  This in turn can lead to damp penetrating the wall of your building or damp getting to the roof joists. Gutter blockage and overflow can lead to extremely expensive repairs to your property. The other problem associated with blocked guttering and drainpipes is the inherent danger of inspecting and cleaning them. Use of ladders should be avoided at all times if there is an alternative, namely the Gutter Mate Filter.  Downpipe (Drainpipe) Sizes  The GutterMate is designed to accept 68mm, 76mm and 80mm diameter and 65mm and 75mm square downpipes, without any adaptors or reducers, other than the square to round adaptor supplied with the filter, if needed as per the instructions. This adaptor is used if your square downpipe is fitted using ‚Äúclose fitting mounting brackets‚Äù to your house.  If the downpipe is fitted with ‚Äústandoff mounting brackets‚Äù, the square to round adaptor is not needed. If the downpipe is larger than 80mm you will need a male to female reducer to get into the top of the filter. The GutterMate filter should not be used on downpipes larger than 100mm diameter and if using this diameter of downpipe consideration should be given as to the total roof area the filter is rainwater collecting from. The GutterMate rain water collecting filter can be used in the following applications.  Two common sizes of downpipe for Greenhouses, sheds and garages are 50 and 40mm diameter downpipes.In addition there are some metal downpipe sizes where the internal diameter of the pipe is too small to accept the main outlet of the Gutter Mate.  The filter can be used on these downpipes, when using these sizes a male female reducer will be needed for connection to the main outlet of the filter. The standard reducer available is 68mm female to 50mm, this can be used on either 40 or 50 mm. downpipe.",

      "description": "This BIO-Lime for Lawns by Viano is a high quality lime lawn fertiliser that raises the PH level from acid to alkaline which encourages growth, creates healthy lawns and prevents moss infestation.¬† The lawn fertiliser also boasts magnesium which creates¬†far tougher and greener grass.¬†¬†  When lawn becomes more acidic, it creates an unhealthy environment for grass which is the reason why moss forms - with BIO-Lime the added magnesium provides a healthier environment for the soil which releases more nutrients into the grass and creates a much greener colour rather than the yellow that often occurs - and it also gets rid of the moss.¬† ¬†  The product should be used in combination with other lawn fertilisers and is endorsed by the RHS.  The typical life cycle of the products goes as follows  Step 1: Apply Bio-Lime Winter - early Spring  Step 2: Apply MO Bacter - Spring / Summer  Step 3: Apply Recovery - Spring / Summer / Autum  Step 4: Apply Mo Bacter - Late Summer / eary Autumn  Step 5: Apply Bio-Lime - Autumn / Winter¬†  ¬†  It is advisable¬†to use this product twice a year - once in Spring and once in Autum - and please use gloves too.  The product comes in a 5k box and can treat up to 100 square metres.¬†  ¬†  Bio-Lime is a granular lawn fertiliser for spring or autumn which raises pH, sweetens the soil and encourages healthy strong grass growth. Bio-Lime also contains friendly bacteria which eat thatch and dead moss eliminating the need to rake or scarify. It also contains magnesium which helps maintain a strong colour throughout the winter months. Available in two sizes: 5kg covers 100 sq m, 20kg covers 400 sq m.  As your lawn grows it takes up nutrients from the soil, normally leading to a reduction in pH (making it more acidic). Rain usually increases acidity further, creating an unhealthy environment for grass. Nutrients become locked, the lawn will not respond to feeding and watering and moss will thrive.",

      "description": "Tiger Worms are the best worms you can use in your Wormery, Supplied in breathable pouches and sent by secure delivery service to arrive in a healthy condition. Our Tiger Worms are sent in pouches of approx 100-120 worms.PLEASE NOTE: Pouches are produced by weight. The number of worms per pouch is dependent on size of worms.So why are Tiger worms best for a Wormery? The short answer:- There are three native species of worm which are all good at the rapid processing of dead organic waste into nutrient rich compost these are:- The Tiger worm, aka the Brandling worm. The scientific name: Eisenia fetida The Bluenose worm, aka Dendobaena and the European night crawler and by some as Eisenia hortensis.  Proper name Dendrobaena veneta The Redworm, aka the red wiggler and the Brandling worm. Proper name Eisenia andrei All are good and will work well in your wormery. But, for adaptability, conditions tolerance, versatility and composting rate the answer is..... The Tiger Worm. Some Worm facts Tiger worms are a little more expensive and significantly but not overwhelmingly better than Dendrobaena in Wormeries. Young worms are preferable (hungrier!) to older worms.  When it comes to composting - the condition, age, size and species of worm is more important than their weight. Tiger worms reach sexual maturity (they are hermaphrodite) in approx 6 weeks. Dendrobaena are more widely available than Tigers as there is an established 'cottage' industry breeding them for anglers who hook them up as bait. They are also easier to harvest and are usually cheaper.",

      "description": "The 400L Aerobin Hot Composter is a device that provides an ideal environment for highly efficient, healthy aerobic composting in most climates, for 12 months of the year. This hot composter has an attractive modern design that will look great in your garden. Composting will contribute to your household reducing the amount of waste that goes to either landfill or incineration, this assists our planets environment. Composting helps people live in a more sustainable way.    ¬†  This composter comes in two boxes, one box for the main component and the second which holds the central aeration lung (flue). This lung assists the quick breakdown of food and garden waste. Two people are needed to construct the Aerobin.  Instructions for assembly.  More details about the Aerobin:    Dimensions Height: 120cm Width: 74cm Depth: 74cm  The Aerobin was developed & designed to enable the recycling (composting) and reuse of most organic materials that are generated at the household. This provides a practical alternative to these materials being collected, transported and dumped at landfill sites or incinerated.  In the natural process of aerobic (or hot) composting, the work is performed by healthy decomposer microorganisms. These organisms are a living thing that require food (carbon & nitrogen), air and water. When they have the correct balance, compost is produced very quickly in this Aerobin.  The Aerobin is vermin resistant.  To get the composting process underway quickly, it is best to add a layer (50mm or 2‚Äù) of compost in the base of the Aerobin. This can be either healthy compost from another composter or compost purchased from a garden centre, just ensure that it's not sterilised.  Waste should be premixed before it is loaded into the Aerobin. This will avoid concentrations of any individual material.  Compost should start to form on the base of the Aerobin (remove the Access Doors) from 8-12 weeks of starting.  This compost bin has a base and a Leachate Tank to collect rich liquid nutrients in.¬†¬†You can purchase a seperate leachate hose extension here.  Rich Leachate should start collecting in the Leachate Tank of the Aerobin within 4-6 weeks. Don't forget to dilute Leachate before use.  The product is fantastic for garden waste and works best when at least half-filled. Do ensure that woody material is shredded or mulched before adding.  Glossy ink printed magazines or cardboard are not suitable for the Aerobin as the inks are mostly likely not biodegradable and can be toxic.  Has a moisture recirculation system, which means you can just drop your food/garden waste in and let the Aerobin get to work!",

      "description": "The 200L Aerobin Hot Composter is a device that provides an ideal environment for highly efficient, healthy aerobic composting in most climates, for 12 months of the year. This hot composter has an attractive modern design that will look great in your garden.  Composting will contribute to your household reducing the amount of waste that goes to either landfill or incineration, this assists our planets environment. Composting helps people live in a more sustainable way.    ¬†    This composter comes in two boxes, one box for the main component and the second which holds the central aeration lung (flue). This lung assists the quick breakdown of food and garden waste. Two people are needed to construct the Aerobin.  ¬†  Instructions for assembly. More details about the Aerobin:  ¬†    Dimensions Height: 117.5cm Width: 51cm Depth: 51cm  Packaging Dimensions Height: 15.9cm Width: 54cm Depth: 49cm Weight: 15.9kg  The Aerobin was developed & designed to enable the recycling (composting) and reuse of most organic materials that are generated at the household. This provides a practical alternative to these materials being collected, transported and dumped at landfill sites or incinerated.  In the natural process of aerobic (or hot) composting, the work is performed by healthy decomposer microorganisms. These organisms are a living thing that require food (carbon & nitrogen), air and water. When they have the correct balance, compost is produced very quickly in this Aerobin.  The Aerobin is vermin resistant.  To get the composting process underway quickly, it is best to add a layer (50mm or 2‚Äù) of compost in the base of the Aerobin. This can be either healthy compost from another composter or compost purchased from a garden centre, just ensure that it's not sterilised.  Waste should be premixed before it is loaded into the Aerobin. This will avoid concentrations of any individual material.  Compost should start to form on the base of the Aerobin (remove the Access Doors) from 8-12 weeks of starting.  This compost bin has a base and a Leachate Tank to collect rich liquid nutrients in.¬† You can purchase a seperate leachate hose extension here.  Rich Leachate should start collecting in the Leachate Tank of the Aerobin within 4-6 weeks. Don't forget to dilute Leachate before use.  The product is fantastic for garden waste and works best when at least half-filled. Do ensure that woody material is shredded or mulched before adding.  Glossy ink printed magazines or cardboard are not suitable for the Aerobin as the inks are mostly likely not biodegradable and can be toxic.  Has a moisture recirculation system, which means you can just drop your food/garden waste in and let the Aerobin get to work!  Manufactured from 100% virgin polymer.",

      "description": "This Natural Loofah Bath Scrubber exfoliates, smooths and softens dead skin cells to leave your skin feeling clean and reinvigorated. It is made from the Loofah Plant, an organic and natural material, which is perfect for use in the bath or shower.  So, what is a loofah?  Some people think that natural loofahs are made of sea sponge because of their coarse, spongy consistency. However, a loofah is actually a gourd - a fleshy, typically large fruit with a hard skin. When ripe, the outer layer of the fruit is peeled to reveal many internal fibres. These fibres are then dried out to prepare our magical loofahs for use in your natural skincare regime.  Make greener choices and avoid harmful materials with the Natural Loofah Bath Scrubber. It‚Äôs natural, organic and eco-friendly!  Using your loofah    Simply wet your loofah and add your favourite soap or body wash.  Using a circular motion, simply massage your body and face using a circular motion.  Try to avoid any cuts and scrapes on your body to avoid irritation.  When you are finished and feeling silky smooth, simply rinse your natural loofah and hang it to dry. Then¬†it will be ready to use when you next jump in the bath!",

      "description": "The Fresha Flora Disc is an anti-microbial disc that is placed in a flower vase. It increases the life cycle of the flowers for up to twice as long keeping them healthy and helping them blossom for longer.  The environmentally friendly disc also keeps the water smelling fresh eliminating the need to change the water and keeps the flowers, the vase and the general environment cleaner and fresher. As a result, there is no need to change the water whilst the disc is inside the vase.  The science behind all of this is due to the anti-microbial action of the 99.9% pure silver disc which kills off all fungal, bacterial and viral micro-organisms.  This product is therefore a perfect gift and enhances the flower buying experience. *There is also a money back guarantee on this product. If you are unhappy with the product you can return it to us for a full refund, excluding delivery.",

      "description": "The Fresha Flush Microbial Disc is a silver disc placed in the cistern of a toilet. It destroys germs, reduces limescale build-up and provides a sterile flush every time.  Made from natural materials, the environmentally friendly silver disc is everlasting so there is no need to ever replace it. One should be bought per cistern/toilet.  The Fresha Flush disc uses the same industrial silver you would find in drinking water purifiers and hot tub filters and uses the natural effects of real silver that when immersed in water kills germs, bacteria and water borne diseases.  It also has a strong ultra-neodymium magnet which crystallises limescale preventing limescale forming on toilet surfaces. Water therefore stays fresh, preventing the need to bleach toilets which has a positive impact on the environment and in the long run saves you money.  The high-quality disc is both incredibly effective, reliable and hygienic and abides by European standards.",

      "description": "This Extra-Large Extra-large Muro Mexican Chimenea in Ochre Red is one of the best functioning burners of all patio fires. Their structure and design, perfected over centuries in Central America make them the easiest chimeneas to light and the most efficient burners.

Mexican chimeneas are hand-made and hand-painted, so shapes and colours may vary slightly.  Vital infomation:    place your chimenea on a FLAT surface; you should NOT place it on a sloping surface where it might tip over.  This should be a NON-FLAMMABLE surface such as stone, gravel or bricks. Do not place on grass which may turn brown.  Do not place on wood which may turn brown or catch fire. DO NOT PLACE ON DECKING which may turn brown or catch fire.  DO NOT place your chimenea near bushes or plants or under trees; the heat will damage the leaves and is a fire risk.  DO NOT place your chimenea under an awning; it will burn or melt.  ¬†DO NOT place your chimenea near garden furniture, especially made of fabric or woven plastic, which may melt or catch.fire.  We recommend at least one metre minimum distance.  DO NOT make a real fire inside a conservatory, summer house or garden shed. Chimeneas burning wood, coal or charcoal.  can only be used outside, because fumes and gases from the fire are poisonous and dangerous to health.  Carbon monoxide gas has no colour nor odour and is deadly.  NEVER LEAVE A BURNING CHIMENEA UNATTENDED!    Accessories included:Stand and lid  ¬†",

Their structure and design, perfected over centuries in Central America make them the easiest chimeneas to light and the most efficient burners. No need for roaring fires, the clay becomes hot and radiates the heat. It is important you observe the instructions and maintenance recommendations. Not all fuels and lighting fuels can be used in Mexican chimeneas and they will need protection from the weather. Mexican chimeneas are hand-made and hand-painted, so shapes and colours may vary slightly. The paint finish on this chimenea will discolour when fired or if left outside all the time. Colour changes do not affect use. Mexican chimeneas can be repainted.

Quite simply the bacteria accelerate the speed at which the waste material is disposed of.        They do this by producing enzymes, which breakdown the different components of the waste allowing the bacteria to absorb the waste as food and eventually convert it into CO2 and water, they ensure the degradation process is working.        There are a number of different strains of bacteria in the Accelerator Powder to produce the different types of enzymes required to cover the range of household food waste.        The four principal enzyme types that the micro-organisms in Accelerator produce are:    Lipases: to digest fats found in butter, other diary produce, meat, game, poultry, cooking oils, and shortening.    Amylases: to digest carbohydrates found in potato peelings, bread, biscuits, starch, rice and pasta.    Proteases: to digest proteins found in meats, milk, milk produce and eggs.    Cellulases: to digest cellulose found in all vegetable matter, fruit skins and peels.        Within the Green Cone Accelerator Powder formulation there are both mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria on a cereal base.        The mesophiles initiate the process of breaking down the household food waste when it first enters the Green Cone and then the thermophiles take over as the temperature increases towards the bottom of the Green Cone. The high temperatures encountered at this stage, results in the death of many of the useful mesophiles.        The addition of Green Cone Accelerator Powder daily will ensure that a healthy population of safe bacteria is always present and keep the degradation process working efficiently.",

The 3 Tray Standard Tiger Rainbow Wormery Dark Cobalt Blue operates very simply and harnesses the surface-feeding nature of the Tiger Worms that live inside it.  As the worm composting unit fills, the worms follow the food upwards through the holes in the base of the trays leaving behind their rich organic compost in the trays below. By the time the top tray is full, the bottom tray is ready to harvest worm compost so you simply empty it and pop it back on top. You just keep the system going and the liquid fertiliser gathers in a chamber at the bottom where there is a tap to drain it into your watering can.  Our Tiger Wormeries are manufactured from high quality recycled plastic and come with a 5-year warranty. They are easy to use and will even look after themselves while you go on holiday. The Tiger Wormery also makes for a fantastic present for Christmas or birthdays!

The 3 Tray Standard Tiger Rainbow Wormery Electric Red operates very simply and harnesses the surface-feeding nature of the Tiger Worms that live inside it. As the worm composting unit fills, the worms follow the food upwards through the holes in the base of the trays leaving behind their rich organic compost in the trays below.

Our Tiger Wormeries are manufactured from high quality recycled plastic and come with a 5 year warranty. They are easy to use and will even look after themselves while you go on holiday. The Tiger Wormery also makes for a fantastic present for Christmas or birthdays!

The 4 Tray Deluxe Tiger Rainbow Wormery Dark Orchid Purple operates very simply and harnesses the 'surface-feeding' nature of the Tiger Worms that live inside it. As the unit fills, the worms follow the food upwards through the holes in the base of the trays leaving behind their rich organic vermicompost in the trays below. By the time the top tray is full, the bottom tray is ready to harvest worm compost so you simply empty it and pop it back on top. You just keep the system going and the liquid fertiliser gathers in a chamber at the bottom where there is a tap to drain it into your watering can.  Our Tiger Wormeries are manufactured from high quality recycled plastic and come with a 5 year warranty. They are easy to use and will even look after themselves while you go on holiday. The Tiger Wormery also makes for a fantastic present for Christmas or birthdays!  Please note: Our wormeries should be stored under a roof or in a secluded and sheltered area for best results as they're not rainproof and could flood in the event of heavy showers, but they are perfect for a garage, shed or out-building. Avoid putting them in direct sunlight or out in freezing conditions.  What do I get?

      "description": "The 3 Tray Standard Pet & Dog Poo Wormery Black is a great way to turn pet and dog poo into great vermicompost and a liquid fertiliser for your garden. Because of the nature of the waste (faeces) do not use the end compost in vegetable patches or in areas where young children would play, but it is an excellent conditioner to be dug into your garden or used as a bedding for shrubbery and flower beds. You may even choose to continue disposing of your dog waste, but reduce the quantity vastly by processing it through the Pet and Dog Poo Wormery first.  Our Pet and Dog Poo Wormeries come with everything you need to start disposing of your dog waste straight away. Organic-based biodegradable cat litter is also fine to use and can be added to our Wormeries. If this added, you should only add a small amount at a time and lime mix should be added with this, due to the worms being sensitive to ammonia found in urine.  Please note: Our wormeries should be stored under a roof or in a secluded and sheltered area for best results as they're not rainproof and could flood in the event of heavy showers, but they are perfect for a garage, shed or out-building. Avoid putting them in direct sunlight or out in freezing conditions. For more information, have a look at our FAQs, how to guide and View our new ‚ÄòHow to Build Your Pet Poo Wormery Guide‚Äô which includes a step-by-step process for setting up your wormery.  What do I get?    100 Tiger Worms or a Worm Card Voucher*  Approx. 2kg Bokashi Bran to speed up the decomposition process  3 or more composting trays depending on choice made  1.5kg of Lime Mix  Coir Worm Bedding  A Drainage Sump Tray, a tap and a lid *If you are buying a Wormery as a gift or don't intend to set it up straight away, we suggest you get it delivered with a worm card voucher instead of live worms. Then when you or the other person is ready to set it up, return the worm card by post and we will send the live tiger worms out to you. Full instructions are provided for easy operation.    Which Wormery is right for me? The 3 Tray Pet and Dog Poo Wormery is suitable for 2-3 average sized dogs or 1-2 large dogs with the added benefit of extra composting time for the full trays. The 4 Tray Pet and Dog Poo Wormery is suitable for 3-4 average dogs or 2-3 large dogs with the added benefit of extra composting time for the full trays. Extra trays are available separately in wormery accessories if you want to upgrade at a later date. Each tray holds approx 15.5 litres.  Our Pet and Dog Poo Wormeries are manufactured from high quality recycled plastic and come with a 5 year warranty. They are easy to use and will even look after themselves while you go on holiday and make for a fantastic present for Christmas or birthdays.  How does the Pet & Dog Poo Wormery work? The Pet Poo Converter consists of three or more sturdy, nesting trays with a lid, drainage sump and stand which forms a neat, compact portable unit. The worms eat and breed in the working tray. This has a perforated base to allow any liquid waste to drain through to the drainage sump. The worm poo or worm castings remain in the top section and can be harvested as desired. The bottom sump collects the valuable liquid waste which can be diluted and used as a fertiliser on your garden.  Is it safe? As long as you use the Pet & Dog Poo Wormery as directed, following the special included instructions carefully - it is safe to use. Indeed, commercial worm farms rear the worms on manure. The only thing we recommend is not using the end vermicompost in vegetable patches or where small children may play. It still makes for a great compost for flower or shrubbery beds, however, and of course you can still dig it into the garden or mix with other compost as a soil conditioner.  Can I put food waste into the Pet Poo Wormery? No - well, not at the same time. It is best not to mix the diet by introducing both pet poo and normal food waste at the same time. So stick to either food waste or pet poo. If you are looking specifically for a Wormery for food waste, you'll probably find the rest of our Wormery range more suitable.  Can I use this Wormery as a 'normal' Wormery (i.e. with food waste)? Yes, that is absolutely fine. If you specifically like the design of this particular Wormery, or if you change your mind and do not wish to compost your pet poo any more you can use this Wormery with normal food waste (just not at the same time) and that will work just fine. If you are looking specifically for a Wormery for food waste, you'll probably find the rest of our Wormery range more suitable.  **The last image shows the results the liquid fertiliser can produce for your garden flowers and crops**  Dimensions :   3 Tray ASSEMBLED W/ COMPOSTHeight: 53cm - 74cmWidth: 42cmDepth: 42cm  ASSEMBLED W/ COMPOST is a working wormery where the height will vary depending on the amounts of compost and worms in it.

      "description": "The 4 Tray Standard Pet & Dog Poo Wormery Black is a great way to turn pet and dog poo into great vermicompost and a liquid fertiliser for your garden. Because of the nature of the waste (faeces) do not use the end compost in vegetable patches or in areas where young children would play, but it is an excellent conditioner to be dug into your garden or used as a bedding for shrubbery and flower beds. You may even choose to continue disposing of your dog waste, but reduce the quantity vastly by processing it through the Pet and Dog Poo Wormery first.  Our Pet and Dog Poo Wormeries come with everything you need to start disposing of your dog waste straight away. Organic-based biodegradable cat litter is also fine to use and can be added to our Wormeries. If this added, you should only add a small amount at a time and lime mix should be added with this, due to the worms being sensitive to ammonia found in urine.  Please note: Our wormeries should be stored under a roof or in a secluded and sheltered area for best results as they're not rainproof and could flood in the event of heavy showers, but they are perfect for a garage, shed or out-building. Avoid putting them in direct sunlight or out in freezing conditions. For more information, have a look at our FAQs, how to guide and View our new ‚ÄòBuilding Your Pet Poo Wormery Guide‚Äô which includes a step-by-step process for setting up your wormery.  What do I get?    100 Tiger Worms or a Worm Card Voucher*  Approx. 2kg Bokashi Bran to speed up the decomposition process  3 or more composting trays depending on choice made  Coir Worm Bedding  1.5kg of Lime Mix  A Drainage Sump Tray, a tap and a lid *If you are buying a Wormery as a gift or don't intend to set it up straight away, we suggest you get it delivered with a worm card voucher instead of live worms. Then when you or the other person is ready to set it up, return the worm card by post and we will send the live tiger worms out to you. Full instructions are provided for easy operation.    Which Wormery is right for me? The 3 Tray Pet and Dog Poo Wormery is suitable for 2-3 average sized dogs or 1-2 large dogs with the added benefit of extra composting time for the full trays. The 4 Tray Pet and Dog Poo Wormery is suitable for 3-4 average dogs or 2-3 large dogs with the added benefit of extra composting time for the full trays. Extra trays are available separately in wormery accessories if you want to upgrade at a later date. Each tray holds approx 15.5 litres.  Our Pet and Dog Poo Wormeries are manufactured from high quality recycled plastic and come with a 5 year warranty. They are easy to use and will even look after themselves while you go on holiday and make for a fantastic present for Christmas or birthdays.  How does the Pet & Dog Poo Wormery work? The Pet Poo Converter consists of three or more sturdy, nesting trays with a lid, drainage sump and stand which forms a neat, compact portable unit. The worms eat and breed in the working tray. This has a perforated base to allow any liquid waste to drain through to the drainage sump. The worm poo or worm castings remain in the top section and can be harvested as desired. The bottom sump collects the valuable liquid waste which can be diluted and used as a fertiliser on your garden.  Is it safe? As long as you use the Pet & Dog Poo Wormery as directed, following the special included instructions carefully - it is safe to use. Indeed, commercial worm farms rear the worms on manure. The only thing we recommend is not using the end vermicompost in vegetable patches or where small children may play. It still makes for a great compost for flower or shrubbery beds, however, and of course you can still dig it into the garden or mix with other compost as a soil conditioner.  Can I put food waste into the Pet Poo Wormery? No - well, not at the same time. It is best not to mix the diet by introducing both pet poo and normal food waste at the same time. So stick to either food waste or pet poo. If you are looking specifically for a Wormery for food waste, you'll probably find the rest of our Wormery range more suitable.  Can I use this Wormery as a 'normal' Wormery (i.e. with food waste)? Yes, that is absolutely fine. If you specifically like the design of this particular Wormery, or if you change your mind and do not wish to compost your pet poo any more you can use this Wormery with normal food waste (just not at the same time) and that will work just fine. If you are looking specifically for a Wormery for food waste, you'll probably find the rest of our Wormery range more suitable.  **The last image shows the results the liquid fertiliser can produce for your garden flowers and crops**  Dimensions:  4 Tray ASSEMBLED W/ COMPOSTHeight: 56cm - 87cmWidth: 42cmDepth: 42cm  ASSEMBLED W/ COMPOST is a working wormery where the height will vary depending on the amounts of compost and worms in it.

For more information, have a look at our FAQs, how to guide and view our new ‚ÄòBuilding Your Pet Poo Wormery Guide‚Äô which includes a step-by-step process for setting up your wormery.  What do I get?    100 Tiger Worms or a Worm Card Voucher*  Approx. 2kg Bokashi Bran to speed up the decomposition process  3 or more composting trays depending on choice made  1.5kg of Lime Mix  Coir Worm Bedding  A Drainage Sump Tray, a tap and a lid    *If you are buying a Wormery as a gift or don't intend to set it up straight away, we suggest you get it delivered with a worm card voucher instead of live worms. Then when you or the other person is ready to set it up, return the worm card by post and we will send the live tiger worms out to you. Full instructions are provided for easy operation.  Which Wormery is right for me? The 3 Tray Pet and Dog Poo Wormery is suitable for 2-3 average sized dogs or 1-2 large dogs with the added benefit of extra composting time for the full trays. The 4 Tray Pet and Dog Poo Wormery is suitable for 3-4 average dogs or 2-3 large dogs with the added benefit of extra composting time for the full trays. Extra trays are available separately in wormery accessories if you want to upgrade at a later date. Each tray holds approx 15.5 litres. Our Pet and Dog Poo Wormeries are manufactured from high quality recycled plastic and come with a 5 year warranty. They are easy to use and will even look after themselves while you go on holiday and make for a fantastic present for Christmas or birthdays.  How does the Pet & Dog Poo Wormery work? The Pet Poo Converter consists of three or more sturdy, nesting trays with a lid, drainage sump and stand which forms a neat, compact portable unit. The worms eat and breed in the working tray. This has a perforated base to allow any liquid waste to drain through to the drainage sump. The worm poo or worm castings remain in the top section and can be harvested as desired. The bottom sump collects the valuable liquid waste which can be diluted and used as a fertiliser on your garden.  Is it safe? As long as you use the Pet & Dog Poo Wormery as directed, following the special included instructions carefully - it is safe to use. Indeed, commercial worm farms rear the worms on manure. The only thing we recommend is not using the end vermicompost in vegetable patches or where small children may play. It still makes for a great compost for flower or shrubbery beds, however, and of course you can still dig it into the garden or mix with other compost as a soil conditioner.  Can I put food waste into the Pet Poo Wormery? No - well, not at the same time. It is best not to mix the diet by introducing both pet poo and normal food waste at the same time. So stick to either food waste or pet poo. If you are looking specifically for a Wormery for food waste, you'll probably find the rest of our Wormery range more suitable.  Can I use this Wormery as a 'normal' Wormery (i.e. with food waste)? Yes, that is absolutely fine. If you specifically like the design of this particular Wormery, or if you change your mind and do not wish to compost your pet poo any more you can use this Wormery with normal food waste (just not at the same time) and that will work just fine. If you are looking specifically for a Wormery for food waste, you'll probably find the rest of our Wormery range more suitable.  **The last image shows the results the liquid fertiliser can produce for your garden flowers and crops**  Dimensions:  4 Tray ASSEMBLED W/ COMPOSTHeight: 56cm - 87cmWidth: 42cmDepth: 42cm  ASSEMBLED W/ COMPOST is a working wormery where the height will vary depending on the amounts of compost and worms in it.

      "description": "The 3 Tray Standard Pet & Dog Poo Wormery Dark Cobalt Blue is a great way to turn pet and dog poo into great vermicompost and a liquid fertiliser for your garden. Because of the nature of the waste (faeces) do not use the end compost in vegetable patches or in areas where young children would play, but it is an excellent conditioner to be dug into your garden or used as a bedding for shrubbery and flower beds.

Our Pet and Dog Poo Wormeries come with everything you need to start disposing of your dog waste straight away. Organic-based biodegradable cat litter is also fine to use and can be added to our Wormeries.

So stick to either food waste or pet poo. If you are looking specifically for a Wormery for food waste, you'll probably find the rest of our Wormery range more suitable.  Can I use this Wormery as a 'normal' Wormery (i.e. with food waste)? Yes, that is absolutely fine. If you specifically like the design of this particular Wormery, or if you change your mind and do not wish to compost your pet poo any more you can use this Wormery with normal food waste (just not at the same time) and that will work just fine. If you are looking specifically for a Wormery for food waste, you'll probably find the rest of our Wormery range more suitable.  **The last image shows the results the liquid fertiliser can produce for your garden flowers and crops**  Dimensions:  4 Tray ASSEMBLED W/ COMPOSTHeight: 56cm - 87cmWidth: 42cmDepth: 42cm  ASSEMBLED W/ COMPOST is a working wormery where the height will vary depending on the amounts of compost and worms in it.

      "description": "The 3 Tray Standard Pet & Dog Poo Wormery Dark Orchid Purple is a great way to turn pet and dog poo into great vermicompost and a liquid fertiliser for your garden. Because of the nature of the waste (faeces) do not use the end compost in vegetable patches or in areas where young children would play, but it is an excellent conditioner to be dug into your garden or used as a bedding for shrubbery and flower beds. You may even choose to continue disposing of your dog waste, but reduce the quantity vastly by processing it through the Pet and Dog Poo Wormery first.  Our Pet and Dog Poo Wormeries come with everything you need to start disposing of your dog waste straight away. Organic-based biodegradable cat litter is also fine to use and can be added to our Wormeries. If this added, you should only add a small amount at a time and lime mix should be added with this, due to the worms being sensitive to ammonia found in urine.  Please note: Our wormeries should be stored under a roof or in a secluded and sheltered area for best results as they're not rainproof and could flood in the event of heavy showers, but they are perfect for a garage, shed or out-building. Avoid putting them in direct sunlight or out in freezing conditions. For more information, have a look at our FAQs, how-to guide and view our new ‚ÄòBuilding Your Pet Poo Wormery Guide‚Äô which includes a step-by-step process for setting up your wormery.  What do I get?    100 Tiger Worms or a Worm Card Voucher*  Approx. 2kg Bokashi Bran to speed up the decomposition process  3 or more composting trays depending on choice made  1.5kg of Lime Mix  Coir Worm Bedding  A Drainage Sump Tray, a tap and a lid    *If you are buying a Wormery as a gift or don't intend to set it up straight away, we suggest you get it delivered with a worm card voucher instead of live worms. Then when you or the other person is ready to set it up, return the worm card by post and we will send the live tiger worms out to you. Full instructions are provided for easy operation.  Which Wormery is right for me? The 3 Tray Pet and Dog Poo Wormery is suitable for 2-3 average sized dogs or 1-2 large dogs with the added benefit of extra composting time for the full trays. The 4 Tray Pet and Dog Poo Wormery is suitable for 3-4 average dogs or 2-3 large dogs with the added benefit of extra composting time for the full trays. Extra trays are available separately in wormery accessories if you want to upgrade at a later date. Each tray holds approx 15.5 litres. Our Pet and Dog Poo Wormeries are manufactured from high quality recycled plastic and come with a 5 year warranty. They are easy to use and will even look after themselves while you go on holiday and make for a fantastic present for Christmas or birthdays.  How does the Pet & Dog Poo Wormery work? The Pet Poo Converter consists of three or more sturdy, nesting trays with a lid, drainage sump and stand which forms a neat, compact portable unit. The worms eat and breed in the working tray. This has a perforated base to allow any liquid waste to drain through to the drainage sump. The worm poo or worm castings remain in the top section and can be harvested as desired. The bottom sump collects the valuable liquid waste which can be diluted and used as a fertiliser on your garden.  Is it safe? As long as you use the Pet & Dog Poo Wormery as directed, following the special included instructions carefully - it is safe to use. Indeed, commercial worm farms rear the worms on manure. The only thing we recommend is not using the end vermicompost in vegetable patches or where small children may play. It still makes for a great compost for flower or shrubbery beds, however, and of course you can still dig it into the garden or mix with other compost as a soil conditioner.

Mix product well before use.    ¬†    Instructions:  For standard treatment apply to lawns evenly at 75g/m√Ç¬≤ (bag covers 133m√Ç¬≤).  For regular top-up feeds, apply evenly at 50g/m√Ç¬≤ (bag covers 200m√Ç¬≤).  For best results use a lawn fertiliser spreader. If treating by hand, mark out the area to ensure even application; do not over-apply to avoid damage to your lawn.    ¬†    After application:  Your lawn will be gradually re-invigorated in the weeks following application.  Grass will become a richer green colour.  It is advisable to wait 3-4 days after application before mowing your lawn.

Watch the Miracle of Metamorphosis Up Close  This educational kit gives children, students and families an unforgettable opportunity to watch caterpillars change into chrysalides and then emerge as beautiful Painted Lady Butterflies. Raise and feed your very own butterflies and then release them into the wild! The entire transformation from caterpillar to adult butterfly takes about three to five weeks.  See An Amazing Transformation  3-5 caterpillars (a live butterfly culture) will arrive in a clear plastic cup with all of the nutritious food they need. Place the cup in a safe place away from direct sunlight. The caterpillars will remain in the cup and will eat, spin silk and grow to TEN times their original size! After seven to ten days they will hang upside down and harden into chrysalides (chrysalides are also known as pupae).  Raise Your Very Own Butterflies  Once the chrysalides have hardened, gently move them to the pop-up butterfly habitat. It will take about seven to ten more days for them to complete the transformation to adult butterflies.

The small mesh version will restrict the hay intake by the horse which is healthier for the horse as quick, rushed consumption by the horses is unhealthy for their digestive system. The small mesh also means that less falls through the mesh and therefore reduced the wastes. It also has huge capacity for the hay which means that the amount of times you will need to be restocking is reduced. You will usually be able to fit at least one full bale of hay into each net. The nets are made from a high-quality polypropylene material and it comes in a wide variety of colours to suit your taste, which you can browse on our equestrian products page.",

The wall art shows the ground reflect the city and the pedestrians from all the rainfall, as they try to keep themselves dry with their umbrellas.

Despite using metal to create this artwork, the paint work gives it a watery finish and a softness which goes well with the mellow scene that is being shown. This would work as a stunning feature piece in your lounge or room, especially as it is over a meter long. The raised metal gives a 3D depth effect to the wall art, making it a unique design.

This bamboo safety razor hits every point of our¬†affordable, effective and sustainable¬†mantra perfectly  Affordable:¬†The handle is designed to last for decades and the blades are a tiny fraction of the cost of big brand multi-blade razors, making the lifetime costs much lower than the alternatives.  Effective:¬†We have found that these single blade razors are actually more effective and give a closer finish than the multi-blade razors we are sold by TV adverts.  Sustainable:¬†Replacement blades come in very little packaging, with no plastic holder, packet and film to try to recycle and a long-lasting and recyclable metal and bamboo handle.  Directions for use:¬†Use plenty of shaving soap and shave after first showering to soften the hair. Take your time, use slow strokes and adjust pressure to suit an open and unsprung blade.¬†",

Irrigation for domestic and commercial gardens, lawns and greenhouses.  Collect and filter rainwater from your guttering and downpipe.  Rainwater for household appliances such as a washing machine or toilet.    Benefits of the Gutter Mate:    Works perfectly with wallmounted water butts like the Terracottage.  The only filter diverter which filters all the rainwater coming down the downpipe.

Only takes 30 seconds to clean the filter.  Saves money - you don't have to pay someone to clean your gutters.    Please note: When the Terracottage water butt is full of water, the weight needing to the supported is 170kg. The customer is also responsible for determining if the wall on which the water butt is to be mounted is of adequate strength. If the wall is not vertical and flat where the Terracottage water butt is to be fitted, such as a rough-cut stone wall, the wall should be prepared to allow the back of the water butt to sit flat and in a vertical position flat against the wall, or a backing plate, for the length and width of the back of the water butt.¬†As suppliers we take no responsibility for this determination.

The 50L is the perfect size for a small courtyard, garden or balcony.  The 50L includes a tap for ease of use. You will need to buy a downpipe filter which provides an entry point for the water from your downpipe to the rain barrel. The filter will stop the unwanted leaves and dirt entering the rain barrel helping to stop clogging and contamination of the water.  Once the rain barrel is full, the downpipe filter will redirect the excess water back down the drainpipe. At the bottom of the rain barrel, you are provided with a tap which allows to you fill your watering can.

Full composting sacks placed in flower borders or in vegetable patches over winter will enrich the soil and act as a natural weed surpressant.  3 in a pack  Composting Sacks are 100% biodegradable.  Two full sacks can be placed either side of the base of a young tree to naturally suppress weeds and feed the young tree.  Product size- W:40cm H:70cm.",

      "description": "No doubt the most in-demand product of 2020 and possibly for a while to come, the anti-bacterial hand gel is now a must-have for all. But with such frequent use, these alcohol-based products can take a toll on the skin.  Citrus flavonoids including Lemon have natural antibacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral benefits and Ylang Ylang contains Linalool, a compound which has¬†antibacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory properties.  We didn‚Äôt feel right taking profits for a product we launched born out of a world crisis. So all profits are donated to our local network of food banks to help fight hunger and poverty and offer much-needed assistance to people in need.  Contains 70% Organic Alcohol.  Bottle capacity: 50ml",

      "description": "This plant self watering kit from Vegtrug is an easy way of ensuring your plants are kept healthy and that they grow to their full potential.  VegTrug self-watering system has a water reservoir in the bottom of planter part that supplies the soil of your plant with the necessary water through capillary action.  As the plants absorb moisture from their roots and lose it through evaporation from their leaves, this creates a 'transpirational pull' where the plant can have a continual source of water, allowing it to grow continuously and at peak performance.  Features and Benefits:    Water Level Indicator¬†‚Äì This shows you instantly when your plants need water.  Water Supply¬†‚Äì This kit includes a shaft that makes adding water/ferterlizer easier.  Water Conversation¬†‚Äì Designed to minimize water losses through seepage or evaporation, the water reservoir is connected to a water level indicator that falls and rises accordingly to the amount of water.  Nutrient retention¬†‚Äì Over watering leads to the loss of precious soil nutrients. Since the water containers are enclosed, the nutrients do not get washed away and are preserved in the soil.  Healthy root growth¬†‚Äì It provides a failproof way to deep-water the container without being concerned about root rot. Well-cared-for root systems encourage larger, healthier plants.    Specifications:    Colour: Black  Material: Plastic  Can be used on small and medium VegTrugs  Dimensions: H 83 x W 29 x D 16cm  1 year guarantee",

      "description": "The Hanging Bempton is simply one of the most attractive and practical bird tables around. It is handmade from FSC certified timber from sustainably managed forests and features decorative woodwork in a painted green finish, with a real Verdigris copper roof and a natural rope for hanging.  Unlike most bird tables which are tricky to clean and become messy, our Hanging Bempton has a clever detachable side panel and re-cycled plastic tray which lifts out for easy cleaning. This also gives access to the inside edges of the bird table so they may be brushed out removing any old food which may harbour bacteria. This allows for excellent standards of bird hygiene to be achieved.  The balustrade of latticework and arches around the Bempton provide a restricted height, safe area for smaller birds to feed. This space limitation prevents access by larger species such as crows, pigeons, magpies, seagulls from the food. It also makes life difficult for predatory sparrow hawks whose habit is to target small birds on open feeder tables.  Features:    Suitable for all different feed types  Easy clean  FSC certified timber  Repaint annually to maintain appearance    Note: Colour and patina of real copper roof may vary",

It can be hung from almost anything and the birds can grip onto the front green recycled plastic bar to feed easily.  The lid simply pops off when you need to replenish the bird seed, and this should be done as soon as supplies are getting low.  Feeding birds throughout the year is important, but especially during winter when natural food sources run low.",

In finding cover they are able to save essential body fat which aids their survival.  A metal frame gives the cabin strength and the roof has a cosy liner. The rattan landing platform & low wall provides the divide between entrance and roosting or nesting space.  Dimensions:H 16.5 cm x W 30.0 cm x D 16.0 cm",

      "description": "Handle  Designed in England, made from biodegradable & sustainable bamboo in China (where it grows). The base is painted¬†to avoid bedtime arguments and stop it going mouldy!  Bristles  The bristles are made from¬†BPA-free nylon - the vegan & effective option for cleaning teeth, which does not fully biodegrade. With the rest of the brush being plastic free, you are still buying a product with 95%+ less plastic than any mainstream toothbrush. Rest assured, we are researching plastic free alternatives, but it has to be genuinely eco-friendly, ethical and clean your teeth! These are coloured the same as the handle base, which again helps bathroom identification in a household that has gone 100% for bamboo! Adult toothbrushes are medium-bristled.  Brush Care  Rinsing the brush thoroughly then tapping it against your hand to remove excess water will improve performance & lifespan. Dentists recommend toothbrush replacement every 3 months (and who are we to argue).  The Box  Compostable or recyclable cardboard box, no plastic windows or coatings, just a box really‚Ä¶ Like the rest of the product, it is completely vegan-friendly.  Disposal  The nylon bristles can be extracted for recycling if your local centre takes it. The handles will break down and can go in with green garden waste, into wood recycling or be reused as a plant marker or similar.  Why?  There are approximately 3.5 billion toothbrushes used annually across the world and the vast majority of them are plastic, meaning they hang around for centuries. Strange to think the first ever plastic toothbrush is probably sat in a long forgotten waste tip somewhere waiting for a future equivalent of the fictional rubbish robot, Wall-E to discover it again.",
